https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/louisiana-flooding-natural-disaster-weather-climate-change-oliver-milman-the-guardian/,"The historic and are the latest in a series of heavy deluges that some climate scientists warn will become even more common as the world continues to warm . On Tuesday , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) is set to classify the Louisiana disaster as the eighth flood considered to be a once - in - every-500 - years event to have taken place in the US in little over 12 months . Since May of last year , dozens of people have been killed and thousands of homes have been swamped with water in extreme events in Oklahoma , Texas , South Carolina , West Virginia and Maryland . Noaa considers these floods extreme because , based on historical rainfall records , they should be expected to occur only once every 500 years . The Louisiana flooding has been so exceptional that some places in the state experienced storm conditions considered once - every-1,000 - year events . Close to 2 ft of rain fell over a 48 - hour period in parts of southern Louisiana , causing residents to scramble to safety from flooded homes and cars . At least six people have died , with another 20,000 people having to be rescued . Even Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards had to evacuate after his governor ’s mansion in Baton Rouge was swamped with chest - high water . A federal state of emergency has been declared , with 12,000 people crowding into shelters . The National Weather Service balloon released in New Orleans on Friday showed near - record levels of atmospheric moisture , prompting the service to state : “ We are in record territory . ” Climate scientists have warned that the build - up of moisture in the atmosphere , driven by warming temperatures , is likely to cause a greater number of floods in the future . “ We have been on an upward trend in terms of heavy rainfall events over the past two decades , which is likely related to the amount of water vapor going up in the atmosphere , ” said Dr Kenneth Kunkel , of the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites . “ There ’s a very tight loop – as surface temperatures of the oceans warm up , the immediate response is more water vapor in the atmosphere . We ’re in a system inherently capable of producing more floods . ” The number of heavy rainfall events in the US has risen well above the long - term average since the 1990s , with large regional variances . While the north - east , midwest and upper great plains have experienced a 30 % increase in heavy rainfall episodes – considered once - in - every - five year downpours – parts of the west , particularly California , have been parched by drought . Warmer air , influenced by heat - trapping gases released by human activity , can contain more water vapor than cooler air . With the extra heat helping nourish storms , scientists expect global warming to help produce more intense downpours . “ Assuming we do n’t change our ways , warming is a virtual certainty and increased water vapor is virtual certainty , ” Kunkel said . “ That means increases in heavy rainfall is virtual certainty . ” While scientists are loathe to attribute any single event to changes in the climate , they state that warming temperatures are helping tip the scales towards altered precipitation . Some , however , bristle at the belief that because floods and storms have always occurred , they should not be linked to climate change . Dr Kevin Trenberth , senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , said the major floods seen in the US had a “ clear human component in them . I have seen only a few reports and none mention climate change at all . It is pathetic . ” There are plenty of influences on rainfall levels , including natural variation and topography . One of the biggest variables will be how much warmer the world will become – Trenberth said each 1C increase in temperature can add 7 % more moisture in the atmosphere . But plotting exact projections between warming and the magnitude of downpours is something scientists are still working on . “ Changes in the global water cycle in response to the warming over the 21st century will not be uniform , ” states the latest IPCC assessment . “ The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase , although there may be regional exceptions . ” With the US suffering more weather - related disasters than any other country , an increase in rainfall , storm and hurricane intensity is something that could start demanding more attention from lawmakers . “ It ’s prudent to consider that if you ’re building something with a 100 - year lifetime , it ’s virtually certain that it will experience an increase in extreme rainfall , ” Kunkel said . “ We either pay now or pay later . If we build resiliency into infrastructure , we can protect life and property .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scientists-just-detected-major-change-earths-oceans-linked-warming-climate-chris-mooney-the-washington-post/,"A large research synthesis , published in one of the world ’s most influential scientific journals , has detected a decline in the amount of dissolved oxygen in oceans around the world — a long - predicted result of climate change that could have severe consequences for marine organisms if it continues . The paper , published Wednesday in the journal Nature by oceanographer Sunke Schmidtko and two colleagues from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel , Germany , found a decline of more than 2 percent in ocean oxygen content worldwide between 1960 and 2010 . The loss , however , showed up in some ocean basins more than others . The largest overall volume of oxygen was lost in the largest ocean — the Pacific — but as a percentage , the decline was sharpest in the Arctic Ocean , a region facing Earth ’s most stark climate change . The loss of ocean oxygen “ has been assumed from models , and there have been lots of regional analysis that have shown local decline , but it has never been shown on the global scale , and never for the deep ocean , ” said Schmidtko , who conducted the research with Lothar Stramma and Martin Visbeck , also of GEOMAR . AD Ocean oxygen is vital to marine organisms , but also very delicate — unlike in the atmosphere , where gases mix together thoroughly , in the ocean that is far harder to accomplish , Schmidtko explained . Moreover , he added , just 1 percent of all the Earth ’s available oxygen mixes into the ocean ; the vast majority remains in the air . Climate change models predict the oceans will lose oxygen because of several factors . Most obvious is simply that warmer water holds less dissolved gases , including oxygen . “ It ’s the same reason we keep our sparkling drinks pretty cold , ” Schmidtko said . But another factor is the growing stratification of ocean waters . Oxygen enters the ocean at its surface , from the atmosphere and from the photosynthetic activity of marine microorganisms . But as that upper layer warms up , the oxygen - rich waters are less likely to mix down into cooler layers of the ocean because the warm waters are less dense and do not sink as readily . AD “ When the upper ocean warms , less water gets down deep , and so therefore , the oxygen supply to the deep ocean is shut down or significantly reduced , ” Schmidtko said . The new study represents a synthesis of literally “ millions ” of separate ocean measurements over time , according to GEOMAR . The authors then used interpolation techniques for areas of the ocean where they lacked measurements . The resulting study attributes less than 15 percent of the total oxygen loss to sheer warmer temperatures , which create less solubility . The rest was attributed to other factors , such as a lack of mixing . Matthew Long , an oceanographer from the National Center for Atmospheric Research who has published on ocean oxygen loss , said he considers the new results “ robust ” and a “ major advance in synthesizing observations to examine oxygen trends on a global scale . ” AD Long was not involved in the current work , but his research had previously demonstrated that ocean oxygen loss was expected to occur and that it should soon be possible to demonstrate that in the real world through measurements , despite the complexities involved in studying the global ocean and deducing trends about it . That ’s just what the new study has done . “ Natural variations have obscured our ability to definitively detect this signal in observations , ” Long said in an email . “ In this study , however , Schmidtko et al . synthesize all available observations to show a global - scale decline in oxygen that conforms to the patterns we expect from human - driven climate warming . They do not make a definitive attribution statement , but the data are consistent with and strongly suggestive of human - driven warming as a root cause of the oxygen decline . AD “ It is alarming to see this signal begin to emerge clearly in the observational data , ” he added . “ Schmidtko and colleagues ’ findings should ring yet more alarm bells about the consequences of global warming , ” added Denis Gilbert , a researcher with the Maurice Lamontagne Institute at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Quebec , in an accompanying commentary on the study also published in Nature . Because oxygen in the global ocean is not evenly distributed , the 2 percent overall decline means there is a much larger decline in some areas of the ocean than others . Moreover , the ocean already contains so - called oxygen minimum zones , generally found in the middle depths . The great fear is that their expansion upward , into habitats where fish and other organism thrive , will reduce the available habitat for marine organisms . AD In shallower waters , meanwhile , the development of ocean “ hypoxic ” areas , or so - called “ dead zones , ” may also be influenced in part by declining oxygen content overall . On top of all of that , declining ocean oxygen can also worsen global warming in a feedback loop . In or near low oxygen areas of the oceans , microorganisms tend to produce nitrous oxide , a greenhouse gas , Gilbert writes . Thus the new study “ implies that production rates and efflux to the atmosphere of nitrous oxide … will probably have increased . ” The new study underscores once again that some of the most profound consequences of climate change are occurring in the oceans , rather than on land . In recent years , incursions of warm ocean water have caused large die - offs of coral reefs , and in some cases , kelp forests as well .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scientists-are-exaggerating-carbon-threat-to-reefs-and-marine-life/,"Claims that coral reefs are doomed because human CO2 emissions are making the oceans more acidic have been exaggerated , a review of the science has found . coral reef An “ inherent bias ” in scientific journals in favour of more calamitous predictions has excluded research showing that marine creatures are not damaged by ocean acidification , which is caused by the sea absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere . It has been dubbed the “ evil twin of climate change ” and hundreds of studies have claimed to show that it destroys coral reefs and other marine life by making it harder for them to develop shells or skeletons . The review found that many studies had used flawed methods , subjecting marine creatures to sudden increases in carbon dioxide that would never be experienced in real life . “ In some cases it was levels far beyond what would ever be reached even if we burnt every molecule of carbon on the planet , ” Howard Browman , the editor of ICES Journal of Marine Science , who oversaw the review , said . He added that this had distracted attention from more urgent threats to reefs such as agricultural pollution , overfishing and tourism . Dr Browman , who is also principal research scientist at the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research , found there had been huge increase in articles on ocean acidification in recent years , rising from five in 2005 to 600 last year . He said that a handful of influential scientific journals and lobbying by international organisations had turned ocean acidification into a major issue . “ Such journals tend to publish doom and gloom stories . . . stated without equivocation , ” he said . The bias in favour of doom - laden articles was partly the result of pressure on scientists to produce eye - catching work , he added . [ … ] Dr Browman , a marine scientist for 35 years , said he was not saying that ocean acidification posed no threat , but that he believed that “ a higher level of academic scepticism ” should be applied to the topic .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-story-on-climate-impacts-of-diet-gets-mixed-reviews-from-scientists-damian-carrington/,"Avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet , according to the scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet . The new research shows that without meat and dairy consumption , global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75 % – an area equivalent to the US , China , European Union and Australia combined – and still feed the world . Loss of wild areas to agriculture is the leading cause of the current mass extinction of wildlife . The new analysis shows that while meat and dairy provide just 18 % of calories and 37 % of protein , it uses the vast majority – 83 % – of farmland and produces 60 % of agriculture ’s greenhouse gas emissions . Other recent research shows 86 % of all land mammals are now livestock or humans . The scientists also found that even the very lowest impact meat and dairy products still cause much more environmental harm than the least sustainable vegetable and cereal growing . The study , published in the journal Science , created a huge dataset based on almost 40,000 farms in 119 countries and covering 40 food products that represent 90 % of all that is eaten . It assessed the full impact of these foods , from farm to fork , on land use , climate change emissions , freshwater use and water pollution ( eutrophication ) and air pollution ( acidification ) . “ A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth , not just greenhouse gases , but global acidification , eutrophication , land use and water use , ” said Joseph Poore , at the University of Oxford , UK , who led the research . “ It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car , ” he said , as these only cut greenhouse gas emissions . “ Agriculture is a sector that spans all the multitude of environmental problems , ” he said . “ Really it is animal products that are responsible for so much of this . Avoiding consumption of animal products delivers far better environmental benefits than trying to purchase sustainable meat and dairy . ” The analysis also revealed a huge variability between different ways of producing the same food . For example , beef cattle raised on deforested land result in 12 times more greenhouse gases and use 50 times more land than those grazing rich natural pasture . But the comparison of beef with plant protein such as peas is stark , with even the lowest impact beef responsible for six times more greenhouse gases and 36 times more land . The large variability in environmental impact from different farms does present an opportunity for reducing the harm , Poore said , without needing the global population to become vegan . If the most harmful half of meat and dairy production was replaced by plant - based food , this still delivers about two - thirds of the benefits of getting rid of all meat and dairy production . Cutting the environmental impact of farming is not easy , Poore warned : “ There are over 570 m farms all of which need slightly different ways to reduce their impact . It is an [ environmental ] challenge like no other sector of the economy . ” But he said at least $ 500bn is spent every year on agricultural subsidies , and probably much more : “ There is a lot of money there to do something really good with . ” Labels that reveal the impact of products would be a good start , so consumers could choose the least damaging options , he said , but subsidies for sustainable and healthy foods and taxes on meat and dairy will probably also be necessary . One surprise from the work was the large impact of freshwater fish farming , which provides two - thirds of such fish in Asia and 96 % in Europe , and was thought to be relatively environmentally friendly . “ You get all these fish depositing excreta and unconsumed feed down to the bottom of the pond , where there is barely any oxygen , making it the perfect environment for methane production , ” a potent greenhouse gas , Poore said . The research also found grass - fed beef , thought to be relatively low impact , was still responsible for much higher impacts than plant - based food . “ Converting grass into [ meat ] is like converting coal to energy . It comes with an immense cost in emissions , ” Poore said . The new research has received strong praise from other food experts . Prof Gidon Eshel , at Bard College , US , said : “ I was awestruck . It is really important , sound , ambitious , revealing and beautifully done . ” He said previous work on quantifying farming ’s impacts , including his own , had taken a top - down approach using national level data , but the new work used a bottom - up approach , with farm - by - farm data . “ It is very reassuring to see they yield essentially the same results . But the new work has very many important details that are profoundly revealing . ” Prof Tim Benton , at the University of Leeds , UK , said : “ This is an immensely useful study . It brings together a huge amount of data and that makes its conclusions much more robust . The way we produce food , consume and waste food is unsustainable from a planetary perspective . Given the global obesity crisis , changing diets – eating less livestock produce and more vegetables and fruit – has the potential to make both us and the planet healthier . ” Dr Peter Alexander , at the University of Edinburgh , UK , was also impressed but noted : “ There may be environmental benefits , eg for biodiversity , from sustainably managed grazing and increasing animal product consumption may improve nutrition for some of the poorest globally .",['Inaccurate']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/playing-semantics-misleading-breitbart-article-downplays-us-contribution-to-climate-change/,"Despite recent attempts to paint the United States as a major global polluter , according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the U.S. is among the cleanest nations on the planet . In the most recent WHO report on air pollution , the United States was listed as one of the countries with the cleanest air in the world , significantly cleaner in fact than the air in Germany , Italy , Switzerland , the UK , Japan , Austria and France . While France and other G7 countries lamented the U.S. exit from the Paris climate accord , America ’s air is already cleaner than that of any other country in the G7 , except Canada with its scant population . Following standard practice , the WHO measures air pollution by the mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter . These are the particles that cause diseases of all sorts and are responsible for most deaths by air pollution . According to the WHO , exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infection , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , heart disease , stroke and lung cancer . The report , which analyzed the “ annual median concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less ( PM2.5 ) for both urban population and rural and urban population ” found that the United States was one of the most pollution - free nations in the world . The annual mean concentrations of particulate matter in the air range from less than 10 to over 100 µg / m3 , the report states . At the very low end of the spectrum , the United States has a concentration of just 8 , while China has a concentration more than seven times higher at 59 , India at 66 , Egypt at 101 and Saudi Arabia with the worst air pollution at 127 . “ The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter is a common measure of air pollution , ” the WHO states . The WHO report is corroborated by a series of other such studies on air and water pollution . In a recent list of the 25 cleanest cities in the world , the only country to boast three cities among the cleanest on the planet was the United States of America , with Chicago coming in second place , Honolulu coming in fourth , and Portland , OR , coming in sixteenth . Unsurprisingly , no cities from China , Russia or India made the list at all . Similarly , another list of the 15 most polluted cities in the world featured three cities from China , three cities from Saudi Arabia , and a whopping seven cities from India . No U.S. city made the list . A third list , ranking the ten cleanest and ten most polluted cities in the world , placed two U.S. cities on the list of cleanest cities on the planet . The list of the most polluted cities in the world was led by two cities from China followed by two more cities from India . Two Russian cities also made the list . Again , no U.S. cities were found here . With such relatively clean air throughout America , how can even reputable news agencies like Reuters continue spreading the well - worn lie that the United States is one of the “ biggest polluters ” in the world ? Rather than follow the time - tested practice used by the World Health Organization , which measures levels of disease - causing pollutants that get into people ’s lungs , some have played a shell game , swapping a new measure of “ pollution ” based solely on emissions of carbon dioxide . The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is . CO2 is colorless , odorless and completely non - toxic . Plants depend on it to live and grow , and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever . Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses , raising levels to three times that of the natural environment , to produce stronger , greener , healthier plants . Current levels of carbon dioxide concentration in the environment are substantially lower than they have been during earlier periods in the planet ’s history . Without human intervention , the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7,000 parts per million ( ppm ) in prior eras , whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm . Some experts , such as UN climate scientist Dr. Indur Goklany , have defended rising CO2 levels as a good thing for humanity . Goklany has argued that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth ’s atmosphere “ is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally . ” “ The benefits are real , whereas the costs of warming are uncertain , ” he said . While the United States must remain vigilant to keep the level of real , dangerous pollutants to a minimum , it may take some consolation in the fact that among G7 nations , it has the cleanest air of all .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-conveys-statement-scientists-stressing-role-of-deforestation-climate-change-oliver-milman/,"The role of forests in combating climate change risks being overlooked by the world ’s governments , according to a group of scientists that has warned halting deforestation is “ just as urgent ” as eliminating the use of fossil fuels . Razing the world ’s forests would release more than 3 trillion tons of carbon dioxide , more than the amount locked in identified global reserves of oil , coal and gas . By protecting and restoring forests , the world would achieve 18 % of the emissions mitigation needed by 2030 to avoid runaway climate change , the group of 40 scientists , spanning five countries , said in a statement . “ We must protect and maintain healthy forests to avoid dangerous climate change and to ensure the world ’s forests continue to provide services critical for the well - being of the planet and ourselves , ” the statement reads . The intervention comes as the UN ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gathers in South Korea ahead of Monday ’s release of an eagerly awaited report on how the world can avoid warming of 1.5C ( 2.7F ) beyond pre - industrial levels , an aspirational target of the landmark Paris climate deal in 2015 . It is expected the report will focus on required changes to the energy system , rather than forests . “ In responding to the IPCC report , our message as scientists is simple : Our planet ’s future climate is inextricably tied to the future of its forests , ” the scientists ’ statement pointedly concludes . Trees and other vegetation currently absorb around a quarter of the CO2 humans are adding to the atmosphere , softening the potential impact of climate change . While the world wo n’t lose all of its trees , large tracts of tropical forests , which hold a vast amount of carbon , are still being lost in the Amazon , central Africa and Indonesia . Warming temperatures are also fueling huge fires in forests in higher latitudes , as witnessed this summer when much of northern Sweden was aflame . “ The forest piece of the conversation is often lost and I do n’t think the IPCC report will highlight it enough , ” said Deborah Lawrence , a professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and a signatory of the statement . “ We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year , which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink . “ Deforestation has been massively reduced in the Amazon , but that has n’t happened elsewhere . As countries get more peaceful in Africa we could lose more tropical forests , which really worries me . ” The IPCC ’s report is expected to mention the need for as - yet unproven technology to burn vegetation and bury the resulting emissions underground or directly suck carbon from the air as a way to meet the 1.5C target . The statement by Lawrence and other scientists warns the former strategy , known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage ( Beccs ) , is untested and risks wiping out huge areas of rainforest in order to make way for plantation timber for energy . “ It breaks my heart to think we ’d lose half our tropical forests for plantations just to save ourselves , ” Lawrence said . “ It ’s horrifying that we ’d lose our biodiversity to avert climate change . Losing tropical forests is not somehow cheaper than putting up wind farms in the US or Sahara . ” Lawrence said a steep drop in emissions to zero by 2040 would negate the need for “ negative emissions ” technology that would damage forests ’ ability to suck up carbon , maintain local water supplies and weather patterns and provide a home for a riot of birds , mammals , insects and other creatures . “ We will have a hotter , drier world without these forests , ” Lawrence said . “ There needs to be an international price on carbon to fund the protection of forests . And countries with tropical forests should maintain large chunks of forests to stabilize rainfall for agriculture and keep a predictable regional climate . ” The prospects for averting at least 1.5C of warming appear dim , however , with a co - author of the upcoming IPCC report warning last week the world is “ nowhere near on track ” to meet its Paris commitments .","['Sound_reasoning', 'Inaccurate']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/sea-level-rise-those-non-disappearing-pacific-islands-bjorn-lomborg-wall-street-journal/,"Once a year or so , journalists from major news outlets travel to the Marshall Islands , a remote chain of volcanic islands and coral atolls in the Pacific Ocean , to report in panicked tones that the island nation is vanishing because of climate change . Their dispatches are often filled with raw emotion and suggest that residents are fleeing atolls swiftly sinking into the sea . Yet new research shows that this is not the entire — or even an accurate — picture . Acknowledging this does n’t mean that global warming is n’t real , or that world leaders and scientists should n’t tackle the adverse effects of climate change , but hype and exaggeration serve no one . Using historic aerial photographs and high - resolution satellite imagery , Auckland University scientists Murray Ford and Paul Kench recently analyzed shoreline changes on six atolls and two mid - ocean reef islands in the Marshall Islands . Their peer - reviewed study , published in the September 2015 issue of Anthropocene , revealed that since the middle of the 20th century the total land area of the islands has actually grown . How is that possible ? It seems self - evident that rising sea levels will reduce land area . However , there is a process of accretion , where coral broken up by the waves washes up on these low - lying islands as sand , counteracting the reduction in land mass . Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea - level rise , leading to net land - area gain . This is not only true for the Marshall Islands . The researchers write that within the “ recently emerging body of shoreline change studies on atoll islands there is little evidence of widespread reef island erosion . To the contrary , several studies have documented noteworthy shoreline progradation [ growth ] and positional changes of islands since the mid-20th century , resulting in a net increase in island area . ” The most famous of these studies , published in 2010 by Paul Kench and Arthur Webb of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fiji , showed that of 27 Pacific islands , 14 % lost area . Yet 43 % gained area , with the rest remaining stable . Representatives from the Marshall Islands have been vocal about the need for strong global action on climate . President Hilda Heine has told reporters that longtime residents are leaving the Marshall Islands because climate change is threatening the nation ’s existence . It ’s true that approximately one - third of the population has relocated to the U.S.—but for reasons more mundane than climate change . Some 52.7 % of the Marshall Islands population lives below the poverty line , according to the Asian Development Bank . Only 39.3 % of the population age 15 years and above is employed . In its 2015 human - rights report on the island nation , the U.S. State Department said that significant problems include “ chronic government corruption , and chronic domestic violence , ” along with “ child abuse , sex trafficking , and lack of legal provisions protecting worker ’s rights . ” Marshallese citizens also have an easy immigration pathway to America and can live , work and study in the U.S. without a visa . It is understandable why Marshall Island leaders might prefer to talk about global warming . But blaming today ’s emigration on rising seas does a disservice to all . Telling viewers in the U.S. starkly that they ’re “ making this island disappear , ” as a report from CNN ’s John Sutter did in June 2015 , makes for good , blame - laden television . But this reductionist , fact - averse rhetoric contributes to the idea that climate - change discussion should be a two - sided , cartoonish fight between those who say it is not real and those who say it is the worst problem facing humanity . Even more insidiously , doom - mongering makes us panic and seize upon the wrong responses to global warming . At a cost of between $ 1 trillion and $ 2 trillion annually , the Paris climate agreement , recently ratified by China , is likely to be history ’s most expensive treaty . It will slow the world ’s economic growth to force a shift to inefficient green energy sources . This will achieve almost nothing . My peer - reviewed research , published last November in the journal Global Policy , shows that even if every nation were to fulfill all their carbon - cutting promises by 2030 and stick to them all the way through the century — at a cost of more than $ 100 trillion in lost GDP — global temperature rise would be reduced by a tiny 0.3 ° F ( 0.17 ° C ) . In a rush to do something — and be seen to be taking drastic action — more sensible approaches to counter global warming have been overlooked . Instead of simply mandating less carbon output , we need more R&D spending on green energy , including more efficient fission and fusion , cheaper solar and wind , and improved storage . New technology is crucial if green energy is to out - compete fossil fuels . Policy makers who want to help the residents of the Marshall Islands today should look at improving the islands ’ resilience and ability to cope with severe weather by improving infrastructure and storm preparedness . Tackling issues like poverty , health care , corruption and domestic violence would do even more . Those who seek to help should keep the bigger picture in mind .","['Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/sea-level-rise-global-warming-climate-change/,"The worsening of tidal flooding in American coastal communities is largely a consequence of greenhouse gases from human activity , and the problem will grow far worse in coming decades , scientists reported Monday . Those emissions , primarily from the burning of fossil fuels , are causing the ocean to rise at the fastest rate since at least the founding of ancient Rome , the scientists said . They added that in the absence of human emissions , the ocean surface would be rising less rapidly and might even be falling . The increasingly routine tidal flooding is making life miserable in places like Miami Beach ; Charleston , S.C. ; and Norfolk , Va. , even on sunny days . Though these types of floods often produce only a foot or two of standing saltwater , they are straining life in many towns by killing lawns and trees , blocking neighborhood streets and clogging storm drains , polluting supplies of freshwater and sometimes stranding entire island communities for hours by overtopping the roads that tie them to the mainland . Such events are just an early harbinger of the coming damage , the new research suggests . “ I think we need a new way to think about most coastal flooding , ” said Benjamin H. Strauss , the primary author of one of two related studies released on Monday . “ It ’s not the tide . It ’s not the wind . It ’s us . That ’s true for most of the coastal floods we now experience . ” In the second study , scientists reconstructed the level of the sea over time and confirmed that it is most likely rising faster than at any point in 28 centuries , with the rate of increase growing sharply over the past century — largely , they found , because of the warming that scientists have said is almost certainly caused by human emissions . They also confirmed previous forecasts that if emissions were to continue at a high rate over the next few decades , the ocean could rise as much as three or four feet by 2100 . Experts say the situation would then grow far worse in the 22nd century and beyond , likely requiring the abandonment of many coastal cities . The findings are yet another indication that the stable climate in which human civilization has flourished for thousands of years , with a largely predictable ocean permitting the growth of great coastal cities , is coming to an end . “ I think we can definitely be confident that sea - level rise is going to continue to accelerate if there ’s further warming , which inevitably there will be , ” said Stefan Rahmstorf , a professor of ocean physics at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research , in Germany , and co - author of one of the papers , published online Monday by an American journal , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . In a report issued to accompany that scientific paper , a climate research and communications organization in Princeton , N.J. , Climate Central , used the new findings to calculate that roughly three - quarters of the tidal flood days now occurring in towns along the East Coast would not be happening in the absence of the rise in the sea level caused by human emissions . The lead author of that report , Dr. Strauss , said the same was likely true on a global scale , in any coastal community that has had an increase of saltwater flooding in recent decades . The rise in the sea level contributes only in a limited degree to the huge , disastrous storm surges accompanying hurricanes like Katrina and Sandy . Proportionally , it has a bigger effect on the nuisance floods that can accompany what are known as king tides . The change in frequency of those tides is striking . For instance , in the decade from 1955 to 1964 at Annapolis , Md. , an instrument called a tide gauge measured 32 days of flooding ; in the decade from 2005 to 2014 , that jumped to 394 days . Flood days in Charleston jumped from 34 in the earlier decade to 219 in the more recent , and in Key West , Fla. , the figure jumped from no flood days in the earlier decade to 32 in the more recent . The new research was led by Robert E. Kopp , an earth scientist at Rutgers University who has won respect from his colleagues by bringing elaborate statistical techniques to bear on longstanding problems , like understanding the history of the global sea level . Based on extensive geological evidence , scientists already knew that the sea level rose drastically at the end of the last ice age , by almost 400 feet , causing shorelines to retreat up to a hundred miles in places . They also knew that the sea level had basically stabilized , like the rest of the climate , over the past several thousand years , the period when human civilization arose . But there were small variations of climate and sea level over that period , and the new paper is the most exhaustive attempt yet to clarify them . The paper shows the ocean to be extremely sensitive to small fluctuations in the Earth ’s temperature . The researchers found that when the average global temperature fell by a third of a degree Fahrenheit in the Middle Ages , for instance , the surface of the ocean dropped by about three inches in 400 years . When the climate warmed slightly , that trend reversed . “ Physics tells us that sea - level change and temperature change should go hand - in - hand , ” Dr. Kopp said . “ This new geological record confirms it . ” In the 19th century , as the Industrial Revolution took hold , the ocean began to rise briskly , climbing about eight inches since 1880 .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-justin-gillis-2014-breaks-heat-record/,"Last year was the hottest on earth since record - keeping began in 1880 , scientists reported on Friday , underscoring warnings about the risks of runaway greenhouse gas emissions and undermining claims by climate change contrarians that global warming had somehow stopped . Extreme heat blanketed Alaska and much of the western United States last year . Records were set across large areas of every inhabited continent . And the ocean surface was unusually warm virtually everywhere except near Antarctica , the scientists said , providing the energy that fueled damaging Pacific storms . In the annals of climatology , 2014 surpassed 2010 as the warmest year . The 10 warmest years have all occurred since 1997 , a reflection of the relentless planetary warming that scientists say is a consequence of human activity and poses profound long - term risks to civilization and nature . “ Climate change is perhaps the major challenge of our generation , ” said Michael H. Freilich , director of earth sciences at NASA , one of the agencies that track global temperatures . Of the large land areas where many people live , only the eastern portion of the United States recorded below - average temperatures in 2014 , in sharp contrast to the unusual heat in the West . Some experts think the weather pattern that produced those American extremes is an indirect consequence of the release of greenhouse gases , though that is not proven . Several scientists said the most remarkable thing about the 2014 record was that it had occurred in a year that did not feature a strong El Niño , a large - scale weather pattern in which the Pacific Ocean pumps an enormous amount of heat into the atmosphere . Skeptics of climate change have long argued that global warming stopped around 1998 , when an unusually powerful El Niño produced the hottest year of the 20th century . Some politicians in Washington have seized on that claim to justify inaction on emissions . But the temperature of 1998 is now being surpassed every four or five years , and 2014 was the first time that happened without a significant El Niño . Gavin A. Schmidt , head of NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan , said the next strong El Niño would probably rout all temperature records . “ Obviously , a single year , even if it is a record , can not tell us much about climate trends , ” said Stefan Rahmstorf , head of earth system analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany . “ However , the fact that the warmest years on record are 2014 , 2010 and 2005 clearly indicates that global warming has not ‘ stopped in 1998 , ’ as some like to falsely claim . ” Such claims are unlikely to go away , though . John R. Christy , an atmospheric scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who is known for his skepticism about the seriousness of global warming , pointed out in an interview that 2014 had surpassed the other record - warm years by only a few hundredths of a degree , well within the error margin of global temperature measurements . “ Since the end of the 20th century , the temperature has n’t done much , ” Dr. Christy said . “ It ’s on this kind of warmish plateau . ” Despite such arguments from a handful of scientists , the vast majority of those who study the climate say the earth is in a long - term warming trend that is profoundly threatening and caused almost entirely by human activity . They expect the heat to get much worse over coming decades , but already it is killing forests around the world , driving plants and animals to extinction , melting land ice and causing the seas to rise at an accelerating pace . “ It is exceptionally unlikely that we would be witnessing a record year of warmth , during a record - warm decade , during a several decades - long period of warmth that appears to be unrivaled for more than a thousand years , were it not for the rising levels of planet - warming gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels , ” Michael E. Mann , a climate scientist at the Pennsylvania State University , said in an email . NASA and the other American agency that maintains long - term temperature records , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , issued separate data compilations on Friday that confirmed the 2014 record . A Japanese agency had released preliminary information in early January showing 2014 as the warmest year . One more scientific group , in Britain , that curates the world ’s temperature record is scheduled to report in the coming weeks . Separate temperature measurements taken from satellites do not show 2014 as a record year , although it is close . Several scientists said the satellite readings reflected temperatures in the atmosphere , not at the earth ’s surface , so it was not surprising that they would differ slightly from the ground and ocean - surface measurements that showed record warmth . “ Why do we keep getting so many record - warm years ? ” Dr. Schmidt asked in an interview . “ It ’s because the planet is warming . The basic issue is the long - term trend , and it is not going away . ” February 1985 was the last time global surface temperatures fell below the 20th - century average for a given month , meaning that no one younger than 30 has ever lived through a below - average month . The last full year that was colder than the 20th - century average was 1976 . The contiguous United States set a temperature record in 2012 , a year of scorching heat waves and drought . But , mostly because of the unusual chill in the East , 2014 was only the 34th warmest year on record for the lower 48 states .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/one-of-the-most-troubling-ideas-about-climate-change-just-found-new-evidence-in-its-favor-chris-mooney-washington-post/,"Ever since 2012 , scientists have been debating a complex and frankly explosive idea about how a warming planet will alter our weather — one that , if it ’s correct , would have profound implications across the Northern Hemisphere and especially in its middle latitudes , where hundreds of millions of people live . The idea is that climate change does n’t merely increase the overall likelihood of heat waves , say , or the volume of rainfall — it also changes the flow of weather itself . By altering massive planet - scale air patterns like the jet stream ( pictured above ) , which flows in waves from west to east in the Northern Hemisphere , a warming planet causes our weather to become more stuck in place . This means that a given weather pattern , whatever it may be , may persist for longer , thus driving extreme droughts , heat waves , downpours and more . This basic idea has sparked half a decade of criticism and debate , and at the cutting edge of research , scientists continue to grapple with it . And now , a new study once again reinforces one of its core aspects . Publishing in Nature Scientific Reports , Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University and a group of colleagues at research institutes in the United States , Germany and the Netherlands find that at least in the spring and summer , the large scale flow of the atmosphere is indeed changing in such a way as to cause weather to get stuck more often . The study , its authors write , “ adds to the weight of evidence for a human influence on the occurrence of devastating events such as the 2003 European heat wave , the 2010 Pakistan flood and Russian heat wave , the 2011 Texas heat wave and recent floods in Europe . ” But what does it mean for global warming to alter the jet stream ? The basic ideas at play here get complicated fast . The study itself , for instance , refers to “ quasi - resonant amplification ( QRA ) of synoptic - scale waves ” as the key mechanism for how researchers believe this is happening — terminology sure to impart terror in nonscientists worldwide . On the other hand , some of this is n’t all that complicated . The Northern Hemisphere jet stream flows in a wavy pattern from west to east , driven by the rotation of the Earth and the difference in temperature between the equator and the North Pole . The flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large . But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does — which is part of the fundamental definition of global warming , and which is already happening — the jet stream ’s flow can become weakened and elongated . That ’s when you can get the resultant weather extremes . “ It ’s sort of like if you confine an electromagnetic wave to a coaxial cable , then you ’re not losing energy , it ’s being tightly contained in that cable and sent to your television , ” said Mann . “ These waves are n’t losing energy , so they grow and get larger and get stuck in place as well . ” What the new study is saying is that in summer , in particular , this can occur . Moreover , it finds that a particular temperature pattern is linked to that behavior — and this temperature pattern , featuring an extra warm Arctic , is becoming more frequent over time , based on both observations and also a review of the outputs of high powered climate change models that the researchers conducted . “ We think that the signal has emerged from the noise over the last decade , ” said Mann . One researcher who co - wrote an influential 2012 study suggesting that changes in the Arctic could be driving mid - latitude weather extremes , Stephen Vavrus of the University of Wisconsin , praised the new research in an emailed comment Monday . “ This study goes beyond statistical correlations and explores a specific process that can plausibly explain how enhanced high - latitude warming trends may trigger remote weather impacts , ” he said . But other scientific authors have expressed considerable skepticism of these kinds of ideas in the past . A recent study in Nature Geoscience , for instance , called into question whether the Arctic ’s melting , and in particular its sea ice loss , has been causing winter cooling over Eurasia , another idea that has been swept up in the debate over the jet stream and weather extremes . One author of that study , John Fyfe of the Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and Analysis at Environment and Climate Change Canada , remarked of the Mann paper by email : “ It is well established that there has been a human influence on the large - scale atmospheric circulation and temperature of the Northern Hemisphere . Mann et al . advance a theory that attempts to link those changes to changes in the spectrum of shorter - scale waves in the atmosphere , which are our weathermakers . I do not believe that this theory is fully developed or that the implications have been fully explored , but I do think that Mann et al . study is a very good start . ” The current study really only covers weather extremes in the spring and summer . For extremes occurring in winter , Mann said , we need to look to other mechanisms for odd atmospheric behavior . Nonetheless , the work represents yet another suggestion that a changing climate is leading to a changing pattern of atmospheric flow , with major implications for the weather felt by a massive swath of the global population .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/breitbart-article-baselessly-claims-a-study-of-past-climate-invalidates-human-caused-climate-change-john-nolte/,"The far - left ThinkProgress reports that scientists have finally proven that the theory of man - made Global Warming is a total hoax . Of course , no one will admit it , but that is exactly what has happened . A new scientific study shows has revealed the following : Current CO2 levels of 410 parts per million ( ppm ) were last seen on Earth three million years ago , according to the most detailed reconstruction of the Earth ’s climate by researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research ( PIK ) and published in Science Advances . Yes , you read that correctly , three million — million — years ago CO2 levels on Earth were the same as they are today , but there is one major difference between three million years ago and today … Three million years ago , we humans were not driving cars or eating the meat that requires cow farts ; we were n’t barbecuing or refusing to recycle or building factories ; there was no Industrial Age , no plastic , no air conditioning , no electricity , no lumber mills , no consumerism , no aerosols . In fact , three million years ago , there were probably no human beings on Earth , at least not human in the way we use that term today . And yet … CO2 levels were the same then as they are now … Hmmm … ? But I thought humans warmed the planet ? That ’s the hustle we ’ve been sold for three decades now — you know , that WE are the problem . We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions - year - old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit . Oh , no , that could never be it — so stop saying that could be , you Denier . Well , what about the Ice Age that occurred thousands and thousands of years before the Industrial Age . Shut up , Denier . And yet … According to the study , scientists also discovered that during this period of Global Warming “ there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica , and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone . ” How is this possible 2,999,971 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger bought his Hummer ? It gets worse : Temperatures were up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer globally , at least double that at the poles , and sea levels were some 20 meters ( 65 feet ) higher . How is that possible 2,999,945 years before Americans moved to the suburbs and lit up the charcoal grills ? Naturally , even in the face of a study that totally debunks the whole concept of man - made Global Warming , ThinkProgress is sticking with that hoax but is also forced to concede the following : The good news is that the Earth does not warm instantly , and mile - thick ice sheets melt even more slowly . So the temperature rise will take several decades , and tens of feet of sea level rise will take hundreds and hundreds of years . But - but - but - but Alexandria Ocasio - Crazy told me we only have 12 years ! And then ThinkProgress drops this anti - science stink bomb : That means the choices we make now can affect the rate of rise and determine whether we blow past 65 feet of sea level rise to beyond 200 feet . Because , because , because Orange Man Bad : Even worse , the climate policy agenda President Donald Trump is pushing — actions that include rolling back U.S. laws that reduce carbon pollution and abandoning the Paris climate agreement — would lock us in to such high CO2 levels , sea levels would rise a foot per decade in just a few decades . No , actually , what this study proves is that there is nothing we can do to stop the Earth ’s naturally occurring climate cycles . Even the worst of the worst , even the most maniacal pushing the Global Warming Hoax admit that , at best , we can only cool the planet a couple of degrees , which will do next to nothing if the planet is determined to again warm itself by seven degrees , as we now know it did 2,999,998 years before the Bad Orange Man approved a couple of pipelines .","['Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Inaccurate']"

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/abc-article-effectively-illustrates-important-climate-trends-for-australian-readers-tim-leslie-joshua-byrd-nathan-hoad/,"From top to bottom , these stripes use Bureau of Meteorology data to show how temperatures have changed in Australia since 1910 . The colours indicate how much the average temperature of each year is above or below the average temperature from 1961 to 1990 . A blue line means that year was below average ; red means it was above average . As you can see there is a pretty clear trend happening — from cool to warm — over the past century . Over this time the world has warmed 0.81 degrees Celsius , and Australia has warmed even more , hitting 1.52 degrees above average last year ( 2019 ) . But what about in your lifetime ? This is what ’s happened in your life . From 1970 to 2019 . Let ’s show it in a slightly different way . The colours mean the same thing , but bars going left show a temperature below average , and bars going right show a temperature above average . In the year you were born , Australia was 0.1 degrees below average , or put another way 1.62 degrees cooler than Australia ’s hottest year on record , which is the one we ’ve just experienced , when temperatures hit 1.52 degrees above average . But what does this even mean ? Well let ’s expand it out a bit . Think back to when you were six . By this point you ’ve seen a few summers , probably run through a few sprinklers , burnt your feet on hot pavement — six - year - old you knows what hot feels like . Well , not compared to a six - year - old today , you do n’t . They ’ve lived through four of the five hottest years in Australia ; you were 44 years old before you experienced the warming they lived through in the first year of their life . Now we ’re going to show you how this warming has already affected your life , or you can skip ahead and see what is in store for the future if we continue on burning fossil fuels as we always have . Small increases in average temperature translate to big increases in the number of extremely hot days , and those hot days have a big impact . High temperatures are part and parcel of living in Australia , but there ’s a point where humans struggle to survive . Many parts of the world , including parts of Australia , already experience this kind of heat . A study looking into deaths around the world from extreme heat found that in 2000 , 30.6 per cent of the world ’s population were exposed to 20 or more days when temperatures reached this point , which they called the “ deadly threshold ” . And when temperatures head towards this threshold it starts to impact the ability of people to lead normal lives . Economic productivity decreases , and the sorts of activities that are a central part of Australian life — like playing sport or heading to the beach — are affected . As the globe continues to warm , this sort of heat will spread , affecting more and more people for longer and longer periods of time . And even well below this threshold , extreme heat already has deadly consequences . The 2009 Black Saturday bushfires , which claimed the lives of 173 Australians , are etched into the national consciousness . But in the heatwave that led up to the fires , the number of deaths soared . In Victoria 374 more people died in the week of January 26 , compared to the average for that time of year . That ’s not to underestimate the impact of bushfires — that innocuous sounding 1.52 degree rise has seen bushfire risk increase across the continent . When the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action approached the Federal Government in April they were drawing on decades of data showing that fire conditions are getting worse . So it ’s hotter , and there ’s a greater risk of bushfires , but has Australia been getting drier ? I mean , there were droughts when you were a kid , right ? Well Australia has n’t been getting drier overall , but where the rain is falling is changing and that is already having a big impact . In the north of the country over summer , we ’re actually getting more rain , but in the south where most Australians live — and where the majority of our food is produced — the country is drying out . And the way the rain falls is changing . Because the atmosphere can hold more water in warmer temperatures , when it does rain we ’re getting more high - intensity , extreme rain events — the ones that are associated with flash flooding . Every degree of warming creates a 7 per cent increase in the intensity of those rain events . So just in your lifetime you can already see a change in how the weather in Australia works . This is the reality of climate change — all the ingredients that are required for natural disasters start to collide with increasing regularity . What could that look like ? Well , those extreme events that used to be irregular occurrences become the normal experience of living in Australia . And for some Australians that ’s already the case . Remember that six - year - old we compared you to before ? Their life has been dominated by drought , as temperature records continue to break . For them , fire season starts at the beginning of spring and rainforests traditionally considered safe go up in flames , rewriting the rule book on how fires must be fought . They live in a world where conditions are so extreme that fire seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres overlap , stretching resources at a time when they ’re needed most .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/the-telegraph-bjorn-lomborg-in-many-ways-global-warming-will-be-good-thing/,"Last week , a study in the prestigious journal Nature revealed just how much CO₂ increases have greened the Earth over the past three decades . Because CO₂ acts as a fertilizer , as much as half of all vegetated land is persistently greener today . This ought to be a cause for great joy . Instead , the BBC focused on warning that the paper should n’t make us stop worrying about global warming , with threats like melting glaciers and more severe tropical storms . Many other major news outlets did not even report on the study . Our climate conversation is lopsided . There is ample room to suggest that climate change has caused this problem or that negative outcome , but any mention of positives is frowned upon . We have known for decades that increasing CO₂ and precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener – by the end of the century , it is likely that global biomass will have increased by forty percent . Similarly , we know that many more people die from cold than from heat . The biggest study on heat and cold deaths , published last year in Lancet , examined more than 74 million deaths from 384 locations in 13 countries from cold Sweden to hot Thailand . The researchers found that heat causes almost one - half of one percent of all deaths , while more than 7 percent are caused by cold . As global warming pushes temperatures up , more people will die in heat waves ; a point emphasized by campaigners like UN climate chief , Christiana Figueres . What we do n’t hear from her is that fewer people will die from cold . One study for England and Wales shows that heat kills 1,500 annually and cold kills 32,000 . By the 2080s , increased heat - waves will kill nearly 5,000 in a comparable population . But ‘ cold deaths ’ will have dropped by 10,000 , meaning 6,500 fewer die altogether . Only mentioning the negatives distorts and degrades the political conversation . Any reasonable person can recognize both positives and negatives among the policy proposals of both Tories and Labour . It is an extreme partisan that insists either side offers only negatives . Yet , this is the position enforced by the climate alarmists – last seen in a letter to The Times from Lord Krebs and company , essentially telling the newspaper to stop reporting less - than - negative climate stories . While it is true any individual news story rarely represents the whole truth , it is revealing that such campaigners do n’t send out similar letters to correct the daily deluge of alarmist stories . The idea that climate is bad for all good things and good for all bad things belongs in a morality play . In the real world , we should look at all the available information . When the BBC warns of more severe tropical storms , it has some validity . The UN ’s climate panel expects to see fewer but stronger hurricanes . But it is an incomplete picture . As the world develops , it has become much less vulnerable : a hurricane hitting Florida kills few people while a similar event in Guatemala kills tens of thousands . Indeed , climate - related deaths have dropped from half a million per year in the 1920s to less than 25,000 per year in the 2010s . A recent Nature study expecting more severe hurricanes from global warming still found that damages would halve from 0.04 per cent to 0.02 per cent of global GDP , because the increased ferocity would be more than made up by increased prosperity and resilience . When the BBC warns of melting glaciers it is reminiscent of Al Gore ’s concern that 40 per cent of the world get drinking water from the Himalayas , and melting glaciers mean “ those 40 per cent of the people on Earth are going to face a very serious shortage . ” Yet , a new study of 60 climate models and scenarios shows this warning fails to take into account the fact that global warming will mean precipitation increases . Indeed , water flow will actually increase over this century , which is likely beneficial in increasing “ water availability in the Indus Basin irrigation scheme during the spring growing seasons . ” If our climate conversation managed to include the good along with the bad , we would have a much better understanding of our options . Climate economics does just that , taking all the negatives ( like rising sea levels and more heat deaths ) and all the positives ( a greener planet , fewer cold deaths ) . A climate economics approach finds that today – contrary to the alarmists ’ massive insistence on negatives - only stories – global warming causes about as much damage as benefits . Over time , climate becomes a net problem : by the 2070s , the UN Climate Panel finds that global warming will likely cause damage equivalent to 0.2 per cent to 2 per cent of global GDP . This is certainly not a trivial cost , but nor is it the end of the world . It is perhaps half the social cost of alcohol today . This suggests that a policy which could eradicate global warming for 1 per centof global GDP would probably be a good deal . Unfortunately , we do not have such a deal on the table . The Paris climate treaty will cost around 2 per cent of global GDP and fix much less than a tenth of the problem . Less effective but more ambitious climate policies cost at least 6 per cent of global GDP per year and likely much more .","['Inaccurate', 'Misleading', 'Cherry-picking', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Biased']"

In the battle against rising seas , the region – which has more to lose than almost anywhere else in the world – is becoming ground zero . BBC Future has brought you in - depth and rigorous stories to help you navigate the current pandemic , but we know that ’s not all you want to read . So now we ’re dedicating a series to help you escape . We ’ll be revisiting our most popular features from the last three years in our Lockdown Longreads . You ’ll find everything from the story about the world ’s greatest space mission to the truth about whether our cats really love us , the epic hunt to bring illegal fishermen to justice and the small team which brings long - buried World War Two tanks back to life . What you wo n’t find is any reference to , well , you - know - what . Enjoy . The first time my father ’s basement flooded , it was shortly after he moved in . The building was an ocean - front high - rise in a small city north of Miami called Sunny Isles Beach . The marble lobby had a waterfall that never stopped running ; crisp - shirted valets parked your car for you . For the residents who lived in the more lavish flats , these cars were often BMWs and Mercedes . But no matter their value , the cars all wound up in the same place : the basement . When I called , I ’d ask my dad how the building was doing . “ The basement flooded again a couple weeks ago , ” he ’d sometimes say . Or : “ It ’s getting worse . ” It ’s not only his building : he ’s also driven through a foot of water on a main road a couple of towns over and is used to tiptoeing around pools in the local supermarket ’s car park . Ask nearly anyone in the Miami area about flooding and they ’ll have an anecdote to share . Many will also tell you that it ’s happening more and more frequently . The data backs them up . It ’s easy to think that the only communities suffering from sea level rise are far - flung and remote . And while places like the Solomon Islands and Kiribati are indeed facing particularly dramatic challenges , they are n’t the only ones being forced to grapple with the issue . Sea levels are rising around the world , and in the US , south Florida is ground zero – as much for the adaptation strategies it is attempting as for the risk that it bears . One reason is that water levels here are rising especially quickly . The most frequently - used range of estimates puts the likely range between 15 - 25 cm ( 6 - 10 in ) above 1992 levels by 2030 , and 79 - 155 cm ( 31 - 61 in ) by 2100 . With tides higher than they have been in decades – and far higher than when this swampy , tropical corner of the US began to be drained and built on a century ago – many of south Florida ’s drainage systems and seawalls are no longer enough . That means not only more flooding , but challenges for the infrastructure that residents depend on every day , from septic tanks to wells . “ The consequences of sea level rise are going to occur way before the high tide reaches your doorstep , ” says William Sweet , an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) . The flooding would be a challenge for any community , but it poses particular risks here . One recent report estimated that Miami has the most to lose in terms of financial assets of any coastal city in the world , just above Guangzhou , China and New York City . This 120 - mile ( 193 km ) corridor running up the coast from Homestead to Jupiter – taking in major cities like Miami , Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach – is the eighth most populous metropolitan area in the US . It ’s also booming . In 2015 , the US Census Bureau found that the population of all three counties here was growing – along with the rest of Florida – at around 8 % , roughly twice the pace of the US average . Recent studies have shown that Florida has more residents at risk from climate change than any other US state . It has more property at risk , too . In Miami - Dade County , developers had 1.6 million sq ft ( 149,000 sq m ) of office space and 1.8 million of retail space under construction in the second quarter of 2016 alone . Sunny Isles Beach , home to 20,300 people , has eight high - rise buildings under construction ; swing a seagull in the air , and you ’ll hit a crane . As you might imagine , the value of development in this sun - soaked part of the country is high , too . Property in Sunny Isles alone is now worth more than $ 10 billion . Many of the wealthiest people in the US reside in Florida , including 40 billionaires on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans ; on a recent week , the most expensive real estate listing in the US was a $ 54 million mansion in Palm Beach . Despite his history of referring to climate change as a “ hoax ” and his recent rollback of emissions - slashing initiatives , President Donald Trump is one of these property owners with a stake in the issue . The president frequently visits his Mar - a - Lago estate in Palm Beach , 75 miles ( 121 km ) north of Miami , which is itself an area experiencing flooding from high tides .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/the-atlantic-accurately-reports-study-economic-impacts-continued-climate-change-us-robinson-meyer/,"Climate change will aggravate economic inequality in the United States , essentially transferring wealth from poor counties in the Southeast and the Midwest to well - off communities in the Northeast and on the coasts , according to the most detailed economic assessment of the phenomenon ever conducted . The study , published Thursday in Science , simulates the costs of global warming in excruciating detail , modeling every day of weather in every U.S. county during the 21st century . It finds enormous disparities in how rising temperatures will affect American communities : Texas , Florida , and the Deep South will bleed income in the broiling heat , while some chillier northern states gain moderate benefits . “ We are really sure the South is going to get hammered , ” says Solomon Hsiang , one of the authors of the paper and a professor of public policy at the University of California , Berkeley . “ The South is really , really negatively affected by climate change , much more so than the North . That was n’t something we were expecting going in . ” Overall , the paper finds that climate change will cost the United States 1.2 percent of its GDP for every additional degree Celsius of warming , though that figure is somewhat uncertain . If global temperatures rise by four degrees Celsius by 2100 — which is very roughly where the current terms of the Paris Agreement would put the planet — U.S. GDP could shrink anywhere between 1.6 and 5.6 percent . Yet beyond its initial findings , the paper represents a major breakthrough for the field of climate economics . Previously , the best financial forecasts of climate change approximated damages for the entire country at once . This new study worked from the bottom up , building its model from dozens of microeconomic studies into how climate change is already affecting regional economies across the United States . Every algorithm in the model emerges from a previously observed relationship in real - world data . “ This is like the adults entering the room . Economists have , for a quarter century , insisted that more work needs to be done to estimate climate damages . This team has done so , ” said Gernot Wagner , a researcher Harvard University and the former lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund , in an email . He was not connected to the study . But this emphasis on the observed means that the research omitted many serious risks of climate change — even those the researchers considered important — if the data describing them was too paltry . The estimates do not include “ non - market goods ” like the loss of biodiversity or natural splendor . In other words : Most people agree that dead polar bears have an economic cost , but there ’s no consensus on how to approximate it . The study also does n’t account for the increased likelihood of “ tail risks”—that is , unlikely events with catastrophic consequences . Many researchers believe that global warming will make social strife , mass migration , or global military calamity more likely , but those events are , by definition , hard to predict . The same goes for economic disaster prompted by the onset of a “ mega - drought ” or the rapid collapse of the Greenland ice sheet . “ When we had the Dust Bowl , we saw everyone clear out of the Midwest and flood labor markets in the urban centers on the coast , ” said Hsiang . Nothing like this kind of internal migration is modeled in the Science study . All in all , the study ’s assessments should be interpreted as the most rigorous attempt ever to describe what global warming will cost the United States in a “ normal ” world . It describes an America that has retained a well - organized economy , held together as a political community , and benefitted from the ongoing general global peace that began 70 years ago . Even in that harmonious world , climate change will make the United States pay . What Climate Change Will Cost Every U.S. County , 2080–2099Across the country ’s southern half — and especially in states that border the Gulf of Mexico — climate change could impose the equivalent of a 20 - percent tax on county - level income , according to the study . Harvests will dwindle , summer energy costs will soar , rising seas will erase real - estate holdings , and heatwaves will set off epidemics of cardiac and pulmonary disease . The loss of human life dwarfs all the other economic costs of climate change . Almost every county between El Paso , Texas , and Charlotte , North Carolina , could see their mortality rate rise by more than 20 people out of every 100,000 . By comparison , car accidents killed about 11 Americans out of every 100,000 in 2015 . But in the South and Southwest , other damages stack up . Some counties in eastern Texas could see agricultural yields fall by more than 50 percent . West Texas and Arizona may see energy costs rise by 20 percent . How Climate Change Will Change Agriculture and Public Health by 2080 Simultaneously , the study finds that some regions may reap moderate economic benefits from global warming . New England , the Pacific Northwest , and the Great Lake states may all prosper as growing seasons lengthen , and the number of frigid , deadly winter days decrease . In the most optimistic scenarios , some counties could see their incomes rise by 10 percent by the middle of the century . This may make some Americans scratch their heads . The high costs of climate change will fall on many of the places where people today seem least worried about the phenomenon . “ Most of the risk maps show that climate change is going to be terrible for Trump country .",['Sound_reasoning']

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/great-barrier-reef-perish-2030s-andrew-freedman-mashable/,"Australia 's Great Barrier Reef is one of the world 's greatest reservoirs of biodiversity . A World Heritage site , it is currently under assault from unusually hot ocean temperatures , which is causing widespread coral bleaching that is damaging and , in some cases , even killing the reefs . Now a new study by scientists at the Australian Research Council finds that the ongoing bleaching event is mainly due to human - caused global warming , and that if global warming proceeds as currently expected , "" large parts "" of the Great Barrier Reef could die by the mid-2030s . The study has not yet been submitted for peer review in a scientific journal . And until this study is reviewed and published in a scientific journal , its results should be treated as preliminary , but consistent with other recent climate science research . The study examines what has caused ocean temperatures to spike to record highs in the Coral Sea region , which encompasses much of the Great Barrier Reef , including the hardest - hit northern reaches . "" This area has recorded a big increase in temperatures over the past century , with March 2016 being the warmest on record , "" the researchers wrote in a piece published at The Conversation on Thursday , a website that publishes academic works . Coral bleaching occurs when coral expels the algae that lives in its tissue , giving it color and nutrients . This action , caused by stresses such as increased water temperature and pollution , leaves the coral skeleton exposed , making it more susceptible to heat stress , disease and pollution . The analysis used methods that have also been used to analyze other extreme weather and climate events , including record heat waves and extreme precipitation events . The scientists found that human - caused global warming made the record warm ocean temperatures and related bleaching events seen this year at least 175 times more likely to occur . The analysis found that climate change increased ocean temperatures by 1 degree Celsius , or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit , during March . The study projects that this year 's extreme warmth is likely to occur every two years in the month of March by the year 2034 . The analysis ' findings dovetail with other research that has predicted the mass die - off of coral reefs around the planet by the year 2050 , as waters warm and exceed the tolerance level of many coral reef systems . “ We have loaded the odds against the survival of one of the world ’s greatest natural wonders ” “ These extreme temperatures will become commonplace by the 2030s putting a great strain on the ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef , ” said lead author Andrew King of the ARC centre of excellence for climate system science , in a statement . “ We have loaded the odds against the survival of one of the world ’s greatest natural wonders , ” he said . Although the study has yet to be peer - reviewed , the methods used to detect the role of climate change in extreme events are becoming more firmly established in the climate science community . "" We hope to submit a more comprehensive version of this analysis for peer - review soon , "" King told Mashable in an interview . Such extreme event attribution studies have been used to detect the influence of human - caused global warming in other extreme temperature events . For this study , researchers looked at temperature data and computer model simulations that included only natural factors that alter the climate , compared to simulations that include human emissions of greenhouse gases . They found that the simulations that include greenhouse gases best fit the temperature data , and using statistical techniques they calculated the amount of the ocean warming that should be attributed to human - caused global warming , something known as "" fractional attributable risk . "" In a blog post , the researchers said that they released the results prior to peer review "" because of the grave nature of their findings and importance of the Great Barrier Reef to all Australians . "" “ We are confident in the results because these kind of attribution studies are well established , but what we found demands urgent action if we are to preserve the reef , ” King said . “ For this reason , we felt it was vital to get our findings out as quickly as possible . ” Coral reefs as the tripwire for "" dangerous interference "" with climate The new analysis adds more evidence for those who argue that global warming may already be causing "" dangerous interference with the climate system . "" That vague phrase from a 1992 U.N. climate treaty established what the nations of the world should work to avoid by cutting emissions of greenhouse gases , such as carbon dioxide and methane . The Paris Agreement on climate change , which 172 countries signed on April 22 , maintains that goal as its ultimate objective , without defining it . This new analysis suggests we have already crossed into "" dangerous "" territory . "" The damage to the reef is a very clear indicator of the harm our greenhouse gas emissions are doing to the planet , "" King said . "" Hopefully this severe bleaching will help to trigger action so that we can curb our emissions . "" A strong El Niño climate event , combined with the impact of global warming and other factors , has prompted unusually warm ocean temperatures and the world 's third - ever global coral bleaching event , which began in 2014 and is expected to continue until 2017 . The bleaching seen in the Coral Sea is part of this event .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-iceberg-larsen-c-size-delaware-jugal-patel-justin-gillis/,"There is no scientific consensus over whether global warming is to blame . But the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula has been fundamentally changed , according to Project Midas , a research team from Swansea University and Aberystwyth University in Britain that had been monitoring the rift since 2014 . “ The remaining shelf will be at its smallest ever known size , ” said Adrian Luckman , a lead researcher for Project Midas . “ This is a big change . Maps will need to be redrawn . ” Thin sea ice Ice shelf 820 FEET DEEP 900 FEET Rift seen from space Beginning of rift about 40 miles from the edge 10 MILES Sentinel-1 SAR imagery | Captured May 31 Photo by John Sonntag | Captured Nov. 10 Larsen C , like two smaller ice shelves that collapsed before it , was holding back relatively little land ice , and it is not expected to contribute much to the rise of the sea . But in other parts of Antarctica , similar shelves are holding back enormous amounts of ice , and scientists fear that their future collapse could dump enough ice into the ocean to raise the sea level by many feet . How fast this could happen is unclear . In the late 20th century , the Antarctic Peninsula , which juts out from the main body of Antarctica and points toward South America , was one of the fastest - warming places in the world . That warming had slowed or perhaps reversed slightly in the 21st century , but scientists believe the ice is still catching up to the higher temperatures . Some climate scientists believe the warming in the region was at least in part a consequence of human - caused climate change , while others have disputed that , seeing a large role for natural variability — and noting that icebergs have been breaking away from ice shelves for many millions of years . But the two camps agree that the breakup of ice shelves in the peninsula region may be a preview of what is in store for the main part of Antarctica as the world continues heating up as a result of human activity . “ While it might not be caused by global warming , it ’s at least a natural laboratory to study how breakups will occur at other ice shelves to improve the theoretical basis for our projections of future sea level rise , ” said Thomas P. Wagner , who leads NASA ’s efforts to study the polar regions . The time - lapse image below shows the rift gradually widening from late 2014 to January of this year . In frigid regions , ice shelves form as the long rivers of ice called glaciers flow from land into the sea . The result is a bit like a clog in a drain pipe , slowing the flow of the glaciers feeding them . When an ice shelf collapses , the glaciers behind it can accelerate , as though the drain pipe had suddenly cleared . At the remaining part of Larsen C , the edge is now much closer to a line that scientists call the compressive arch , which is critical for structural support . If the front retreats past that line , the northernmost part of the shelf could collapse within months . “ At that point in time , the glaciers will react , ” said Eric Rignot , a climate scientist at the University of California , Irvine , who has done extensive research on polar ice . “ If the ice shelf breaks apart , it will remove a buttressing force on the glaciers that flow into it . The glaciers will feel less resistance to flow , effectively removing a cork in front of them . ” Scientists also fear that two crucial anchor points will be lost . According to Dr. Rignot , the stability of the whole ice shelf is threatened , as the shelf front thins . “ You have these two anchors on the side of Larsen C that play a critical role in holding the ice shelf where it is , ” he said . “ If the shelf is getting thinner , it will be more breakable , and it will lose contact with the ice rises . ” Low shelf support High If the shelf front disconnects from the ice rises , a rapid retreat will be triggered . SHELF FRONT Bawden Ice Rise Gipps Ice Rise ICE SHELF NORTH PENINSULA GLACIERS SOUTH PENINSULA GLACIERS Ice rises are islands that are overridden by the ice shelf , allowing them to shoulder more of the weight of the shelf . Scientists have yet to determine the extent of thinning around the Bawden and Gipps ice rises , though Dr. Rignot noted that the Bawden ice rise was more vulnerable . “ We ’re not even sure how it ’s hanging on there , ” he said . “ But if you take away Bawden , the whole shelf will feel it . ” The Antarctic Peninsula may be a canary in a coal mine . The collapse of the peninsula ’s ice shelves can be interpreted as fulfilling a prophecy made in 1978 by a renowned geologist named John H. Mercer of Ohio State University . In a classic paper , Dr. Mercer warned that the western part of Antarctica was so vulnerable to human - induced climate warming as to pose a “ threat of disaster ” from rising seas . He said that humanity would know the calamity had begun when ice shelves started breaking up along the peninsula , with the breakups moving progressively southward . The Larsen A ice shelf broke up over several years starting in 1995 ; the Larsen B underwent a dramatic collapse in 2002 ; and now , scientists fear , the calving of the giant iceberg could be the first stage in the breakup of Larsen C.",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/forbes-article-accurately-describes-research-atlantic-ocean-circulation-weakening-headline-goes-farther-trevor-nace/,"Scientists have long known about the anomalous "" warming hole "" in the North Atlantic Ocean , an area immune to warming of Earth 's oceans . This cool zone in the North Atlantic Ocean appears to be associated with a slowdown in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation ( AMOC ) , one of the key drivers in global ocean circulation . A recent study published in Nature outlines research by a team of Yale University and University of Southhampton scientists . The team found evidence that Arctic ice loss is potentially negatively impacting the planet 's largest ocean circulation system . While scientists do have some analogs as to how this may impact the world , we will be largely in uncharted territory . AMOC is one of the largest current systems in the Atlantic Ocean and the world . Generally speaking , it transports warm and salty water northward from the tropics to South and East of Greenland . This warm water cools to ambient water temperature then sinks as it is saltier and thus denser than the relatively more fresh surrounding water . The dense mass of water sinks to the base of the North Atlantic Ocean and is pushed south along the abyss of the Atlantic Ocean . This process whereby water is transported into the Northern Atlantic Ocean acts to distribute ocean water globally . What 's more important , and the basis for concern of many scientists is this mechanism is one of the most efficient ways Earth transports heat from the tropics to the northern latitudes . The warm water transported from the tropics to the North Atlantic releases heat to the atmosphere , playing a key role in warming of western Europe . You likely have heard of one of the more popular components of the AMOC , the Gulf Stream which brings warm tropical water to the western coasts of Europe . Evidence is growing that the comparatively cold zone within the Northern Atlantic could be due to a slowdown of this global ocean water circulation . Hence , a slowdown in the planet 's ability to transfer heat from the tropics to the northern latitudes . The cold zone could be due to melting of ice in the Arctic and Greenland . This would cause a cold fresh water cap over the North Atlantic , inhibiting sinking of salty tropical waters . This would in effect slow down the global circulation and hinder the transport of warm tropical waters north . Melting of the Arctic sea ice has rapidly increased in the recent decades . Satellite image records indicate that September Arctic sea ice is 30 % less today than it was in 1979 . This trend of increased sea ice melting during summer months does not appear to be slowing . Hence , indications are that we will see a continued weakening of the global ocean circulation system . This scenario of a collapse in AMOC and global ocean circulation is the premise for the movie "" The Day After Tomorrow . "" As a disclaimer , the plot line in which much of New England and Western Europe gets plunged into an ice age is significantly over exaggerated and unrealistic on human time scales . While geologists have studied events in the past similar to what appears to be happening today , scientists are largely unsure of what lies ahead .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/its-official-humans-are-making-the-earth-much-greener-washington-post-chris-mooney/,"Earlier this month , NASA scientists provided a visualization of a startling climate change trend — the Earth is getting greener , as viewed from space , especially in its rapidly warming northern regions . And this is presumably occurring as more carbon dioxide in the air , along with warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons , makes plants very , very happy . Now , new research in Nature Climate Change not only reinforces the reality of this trend — which is already provoking debate about the overall climate consequences of a warming Arctic — but statistically attributes it to human causes , which largely means greenhouse gas emissions ( albeit with a mix of other elements as well ) . The roughly three - decade greening trend itself is apparent , the study notes , in satellite images of “ leaf area index ” — defined as “ the amount of leaf area per ground area , ” as Robert Buitenwerf of Aaarhus University in Denmark explains in a commentary accompanying the study — across most of the northern hemisphere outside of the tropics , a region sometimes defined as the “ extratropics . ” Granted , there are a few patches in Alaska , Canada and Eurasia where greening has not been seen . Starting from this set of observations , the researchers , led by Jiafu Mao of Oak Ridge National Laboratory but including 18 others from multiple institutions in the United States , France , and China , conducted what scientists call a “ detection and attribution ” study . This is an experiment in which differing sets of climate model runs are used to determine whether a particular event or change — ranging from an extreme heat wave , to a coral bleaching event , to a major trend like Arctic greening — is more likely to happen in simulations that include human greenhouse gas emissions , than it is to happen in those that do not . Sure enough , the greenhouse - gas filled computer simulations looked much more like the satellite observations than did simulations that only included natural variability . The study therefore concludes that “ the trend of strengthened northern vegetation greening … can be rigorously attributed , with high statistical confidence , to anthropogenic forcings , particularly to rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases . ” While this formal detection and attribution appears to be new , the report is at least the third study in the past several months alone to highlight northern hemisphere greening and to reinforce this basic conclusion . It ’s one that has often been celebrated by climate change skeptics and contrarians who have long contended that global warming wo n’t be all bad , and that plants might help offset any global warming trend . “ We first find this kind of human fingerprint … particularly the greenhouse gas impact , on this kind of enhanced vegetation growth , ” says Mao , the study ’s lead author . The researchers also dove in more closely to try to determine precisely why so much greening is happening in the Northern Hemisphere ’s colder latitudes . Sure enough , the overall trend was tied to warmer temperatures , although in areas where greening was missing , declining precipitation trends seemed to partly explain the result as well . ( The study did not discuss whether growing wildfires in northern forests may also be countering greening in some areas . ) Another factor enhancing plant growth , meanwhile , seems to be more human - induced falling of nitrogen out of the atmosphere , as we have amped up the global nitrogen cycle with our fertilizers and our fossil fuels ( nitrogen also can enhance plant growth ) . In his accompanying essay evaluating the research , Aarhus University ’s Buitenwerf praises the study but notes that in some ways , the current satellite - based approach represents a blunt instrument . An examination of total leaf area , he notes , does n’t record whether a particular area has changed its type of vegetation , say from smaller tundra shrubs to small trees . Buitenwerf also notes that the science is less clear about what is happening in the global tropics and in the Southern Hemisphere , where greening trends are either less apparent , or more difficult to explain . Still , the subtext of all of this research is clear — a key fraction of all the greenhouse gases that humans pour into the atmosphere each year is pulled back into plants through the process of photosynthesis . This is happening even as the overall warming of the planet may , by lengthening growing seasons and moistening the atmosphere , further stoke plant growth . They do n’t call it the “ greenhouse effect ” for nothing . The key question then becomes how much this process can offset overall global warming over time . And that ’s quite unclear . There ’s a lot , after all , that we do n’t understand . For instance , a recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report found that while Arctic tundras have indeed been greening over the past 30 years , in the past two to four years , that trend has reversed itself . “ Although we already identify this kind of human impact on this historical vegetation growth , for the future , it ’s hard to predict , ” says Mao . He said he is not sure to what extent the greening trend will continue , as “ disturbances ” like wildfires might counteract it , or plants may become “ acclimated to this kind of high temperature . ” Still , the trend is already prompting more optimistic assessments of our climate future in some quarters . Arctic greening was recently cited , in a major report by the U.S. Geological Survey , as the central reason that the state of Alaska , despite worsening wildfires and more thaw of permafrost , might still be able to stow away more carbon than it loses over the course of the 21st century .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/another-arctic-ice-panic-world-temperatures-plummet-the-telegraph-christopher-booker/,"Inevitably , when even satellite temperatures were showing 2016 as “ the hottest year on record ” , we were going to be told last winter that the Arctic ice was at its lowest extent ever . Sure enough , before Christmas , a report from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was greeted with such headlines as “ Hottest Arctic on record triggers massive ice melt ” . In March we had the BBC trumpeting another study that blamed vanishing Arctic ice as the cause of weather which led to the worst - ever smog in Beijing , warning that it “ could even threaten the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022 ” . But last week we were brought back to earth by the Danish Meteorological Institute ( DMI ) , as charted by our friend Paul Homewood on his blog Notalotofpeopleknowthat , with the news that ever since December temperatures in the Arctic have consistently been lower than minus 20 C. In April the extent of Arctic sea ice was back to where it was in April 13 years ago . Furthermore , whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin , this year most has been at least two metres thick . The Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than at any time for years . As for those record temperatures brought in 2016 by an exceptionally strong El Niño , the satellites now show that in recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more that 0.6 degrees : just as happened 17 years ago after a similarly strong El Niño had also made 1998 the “ hottest year on record ” . This means the global temperature trend has now shown no further warming for 19 years . But the BBC wo n’t be telling us any of this . And we are still stuck with that insanely damaging Climate Change Act , which in this election will scarcely get a mention . I leave it to others to speculate on whether , in Theresa May ’s Downing Street outburst against Brussels she was “ speaking for England ” , or had gone off her head . But one leaked detail of her dinner the previous week with Jean‑Claude Juncker and the EU ’s chief negotiator , Michel Barnier , is worth dwelling on . To remind Mrs May of just what she and the EU are up against in the next 18 months , Juncker was said to have plonked on the table two documents , the EU ’s trade deal with Canada and the EU ’s accession treaty with Croatia in 2011 . Both are very relevant to our concerns , because Mrs May not only hopes to negotiate an unprecedented trade deal : at the end of the negotiations , there will also have to be a secession treaty , covering much of the same ground as an accession treaty , but in reverse . The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement ( CETA ) , which gave Canada much less access to the European market than we enjoy now , is incredibly complex , covered 1,598 pages and took seven years to negotiate . The Croatia treaty , like any accession treaty , had to cover 35 “ chapters ” or policy areas , only six of which refer to trade ; and was again extremely complex , filling 124 pages , which took six years to agree . Juncker seemingly invited Mrs May to read these documents , because they each conveyed the awesome scale of the ground her negotiations will have to cover in just 18 months . At every stage , Mr Barnier ’s team will have to refer back to each of the 27 countries he is representing , each of which will then have to ratify what is agreed , with the power of veto if they do n’t like it . Just leafing through those documents is a sobering corrective to any hubristic optimism about what we are taking on .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Inaccurate']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-post-chris-mooneys-earth-no-parallel-66-million-years/,"If you dig deep enough into the Earth ’s climate change archives , you hear about the Palaeocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum , or PETM . And then you get scared . This is a time period , about 56 million years ago , when something mysterious happened — there are many ideas as to what — that suddenly caused concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to spike , far higher than they are right now . The planet proceeded to warm rapidly , at least in geologic terms , and major die - offs of some marine organisms followed due to strong acidification of the oceans . The cause of the PETM has been widely debated . Some think it was an explosion of carbon from thawing Arctic permafrost . Some think there was a huge release of subsea methane that somehow made its way to the atmosphere — and that the series of events might have been kickstarted by major volcanic eruptions . In any case , the result was a hothouse world from pole to pole , some 5 degrees Celsius warmer overall . But now , new research suggests , even the drama of the PETM falls short of our current period , in at least one key respect : We ’re putting carbon into the atmosphere at an even faster rate than happened back then . Such is the result of a new study in Nature Geoscience , led by Richard Zeebe of the University of Hawaii at Manoa , and colleagues from the University of Bristol in the UK and the University of California - Riverside . “ If you look over the entire Cenozoic , the last 66 million years , the only event that we know of at the moment , that has a massive carbon release , and happens over a relatively short period of time , is the PETM , ” says Zeebe . “ We actually have to go back to relatively old periods , because in the more recent past , we do n’t see anything comparable to what humans are currently doing . ” That ’s why this time period is so crucial to study — as a possible window on our own . There ’s no doubt that a lot of carbon — about as much as contained the fossil fuel reserves that humans have either already burned , or could still burn , combined — made its way into the atmosphere during the PETM . The result was a major warming event that lasted over 100,000 years . But precisely how rapidly the emissions occurred is another matter . “ If anthropogenic emissions rates have no analogue in Earth ’s recent history , then unforeseeable future responses of the climate system are possible , ” the authors write . To examine what happened in the PETM , the researchers used a deep ocean core of sediment from off the coast of New Jersey . The goal was to determine the ratios between different isotopes , or slightly different elemental forms , of carbon and oxygen , in the sediments during the PETM . The relationship between the two lets researchers determine how atmospheric carbon dioxide levels , as reflected in the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 , in turn influenced temperatures ( which can be inferred based on oxygen isotopes in the ocean ) . “ In terms of these two systems , the first shows us when the carbon went into the system , and the second tells us when the climate responded , ” says Zeebe . It turns out that there is a lag time between massive pulses of carbon in the atmosphere and subsequent warming , because the oceans have a large thermal inertia . Therefore , a large lag would indicate a greater carbon release , whereas the lack of one actually means that carbon dioxide came out more slowly . The geologic evidence from the new core did not show a lag , the new study reports . That means , the authors estimate , that while a gigantic volume of carbon entered the atmosphere during the PETM — between 2,000 and 4,500 billion tons — it played out over some 4,000 years . So only about 1 billion tons of carbon were emitted per year . In contrast , humans are now emitting about 10 billion tons annually — changing the planet much more rapidly . “ The anthropogenic release outpaces carbon release during the most extreme global warming event of the past 66 million years , by at least an order of magnitude , ” writes Peter Stassen , an Earth and environmental scientist at KU Leuven , in Belgium , in an accompanying commentary on the new study . The analogy between the PETM and the present , then , is less than perfect — and our own era may be worse in key ways . “ The two main conclusions is that ocean acidification will be more severe , ecosystems may be hit harder because of the rate ” of carbon release , says Zeebe . And not only have we only begun to see the changes that will result from current warming , but there may be other changes that lack any ancient parallel , because of the current rate of change . “ Given that the current rate of carbon release is unprecedented throughout the Cenozoic , we have effectively entered an era of a no - analogue state , which represents a fundamental challenge to constraining future climate projections , ” the study concludes .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/atlantic-accurately-explores-climate-context-tropical-storm-harvey-robinson-meyer/,"“ The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm . ” By Robinson Meyer Every so often , the worst - case scenario comes to pass . As of Sunday afternoon , the remnants of Hurricane Harvey seem likely to exceed the worst forecasts that preceded the storm . The entire Houston metropolitan region is flooding : Interstates are under feet of water , local authorities have asked boat owners to join rescue efforts , and most of the streams and rivers near the city are in flood stage . Some models suggest that the storm will linger over the area until Wednesday night , dumping 50 inches of water in total on Houston and the surrounding area . “ Local rainfall amounts of 50 inches would exceed any previous Texas rainfall record . The breadth and intensity of this rainfall are beyond anything experienced before , ” said a statement from the National Weather Service . “ Catastrophic flooding is now underway and expected to continue for several days . ” ( In years of weather reporting , I have never seen a statement this blunt and ominous . ) This means that thousands of people — and perhaps tens of thousands of people — are facing a terrifying and all - too - real struggle to survive right now . In an age when the climate is changing rapidly , a natural question to ask is : What role did human - caused global warming play in strengthening this storm ? Climate scientists , who specialize in thinking about the Earth system as a whole , are often reticent to link any one weather event to global climate change . But they say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey — and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide — suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse . It may not be obvious why global warming has anything to do with hurricane strength . Climate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere . These gases prevent some of the sun ’s rays from bouncing back into space , trapping heat in the planetary system and raising air temperatures all over the world . This warmer air causes evaporation to happen faster , which can lead to more moisture in the atmosphere . But that phenomenon alone does not explain climate change ’s effects on Harvey . Storms like Harvey are helped by one of the consequences of climate change : As the air warms , some of that heat is absorbed by the ocean , which in turn raises the temperature of the sea ’s upper layers . Harvey benefited from unusually toasty waters in the Gulf of Mexico . As the storm roared toward Houston last week , sea - surface waters near Texas rose to between 2.7 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average . These waters were some of the hottest spots of ocean surface in the world . The tropical storm , feeding off this unusual warmth , was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category - four hurricane in roughly 48 hours . “ This is the main fuel for the storm , ” says Kevin Trenberth , a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research . “ Although these storms occur naturally , the storm is apt to be more intense , maybe a bit bigger , longer - lasting , and with much heavier rainfalls [ because of that ocean heat ] . ” This also suggests an explanation for one of Harvey ’s strangest and scariest behaviors . The storm intensified up until the moment of landfall , achieving category - four strength hours before it slammed into the Texas coast . This is not only rare for tropical cyclones in the western Gulf of Mexico : It may be unique . In the past 30 years of records , no storms west of Florida have intensified in the last 12 hours before landfall . Harvey is just the kind of weird weather that scientists expect to see more of as the planet warms . Why do storms normally weaken — and why did n’t Harvey ? As mentioned above , hurricanes feed and grow on warm ocean surface waters . But as they grow , their strong winds often pick up seawater , churning the oceans and moving the warmest waters deep below the surface . The same winds also bring newer , colder water closer to the atmosphere , which usually serves to drain energy and weaken the storm . That did n’t happen with Harvey . The hurricane churned up water 100 or even 200 meters below the surface , said Trenberth , but this water was still warm — meaning that the storm could keep growing and strengthening . “ Harvey was not in a good position to intensify the way it did , because it was so close to land . It ’s amazing it was able to do that , ” he told me . All of this said , a storm like Harvey could have happened even if there was no climate change . Planning experts have long fretted over the possibility of a major hurricane striking Houston . Harvey is also a powerful hurricane forming in one of the most hurricane - friendly regions of the world at the peak of hurricane season . Storms similar to it would form in any climate . But Trenberth says that the extra heat could make the storm more costly and more powerful , overpowering and eventually breaking local drainage systems . “ The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm , ” he said . “ It may have been a strong storm , and it may have caused a lot of problems anyway — but [ human - caused climate change ] amplifies the damage considerably . ” More generally , it ’s still unclear what effect climate change is having on hurricane formation across the greater Atlantic Ocean .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/andrew-freedman-mashable-hurricane-patricia-global-warming/,"Hurricane Patricia , which is threatening the coast of western Mexico with a catastrophic impact , intensified at rates that were among the fastest scientists have seen anywhere on Earth . The storm went from 60 mph winds to 200 mph in just 30 hours . By early Friday morning , the storm was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in either the eastern Pacific or entire North Atlantic basin , which also includes the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean . It 's no coincidence that this storm exploded in an area of near - record warm sea surface temperatures that had not yet been tapped by any other recent storms . It 's also an area where atmospheric conditions were favorable for such a storm to strengthen . [ seealso url=""http://mashable.com/2015/10/23 / hurricane - patricia - mexico/ "" ] Consider this : As of 5 a.m. ET on Thursday , the storm had 85 mile - per - hour winds and a minimum central air pressure of 980 millibars . By 5 a.m. ET on Friday , the winds increased to 200 miles per hour , with an air pressure of 880 millibars . That 's an astonishing 100 millibar drop in air pressure in a 24 - hour period , which is virtually unheard of . The intensification rate looked like a steep staircase when graphed using a satellite - based computer algorithm that tracks storm intensity . A period of rapid intensification was forecast by most hurricane prediction models , though none foresaw the sheer ferocity that the storm would eventually achieve . While scientists have made great strides in recent years in understanding what factors cause hurricanes and typhoons to rapidly intensify , there remain some mysteries about this process . Based on email conversations Mashable had with a half dozen tropical cyclone experts on Friday morning , here 's what we know so far . Warm water served as fuel The storm exploded over an area of exceptional ocean warmth , with waters of 1 to 2 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year . In addition , the atmospheric conditions in this area were ideally suited for a rapidly strengthening storm , with what is known as "" thermodynamic potential intensity "" readings at a maximum . This occurred right in the area where Patricia spun its way into the record books on Friday morning . The ocean warmth is largely due to a near - record strong El Niño event , which has not only raised ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific , but has also caused those warm waters to extend deeper below the surface than is usually the case , which also helps storms to intensify . In addition , most of the storms that have formed so far this year -- and there have been a record number in the eastern tropical Pacific -- have formed well west of where Patricia spun up . These left plenty of undisturbed warm water , which is fuel for a storm like this . "" Basically that area closer to Mexico usually has a lot more tropical cyclones nearby , "" said Eric Blake , a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami . "" Since they were all much farther west , Patricia ended up moving over very warm , untapped waters with the rest of the conditions quite ripe . "" Cooperative atmosphere Ryan Maue , a meteorologist for the private weather firm WeatherBell Analytics , said "" alarm bells "" were ringing on Thursday based on computer model indications that the storm would intensify quickly . These signals showed an "" optimal / perfect atmosphere and ocean conditions for explosive intensification , "" Maue wrote . He said the fact that Patricia is a small storm , with a compact inner core of intense thunderstorms , helped it to "" deepen pressure within a tiny radius of maximum wind . "" ( The storm is smaller , in area , than Super Typhoon Haiyan and Hurricane Katrina . ) Maue also noted that the ocean temperatures the storm is tapping into are the warmest left in the entire northern hemisphere at this date , at about 31 degrees Celsius , or 88 degrees Fahrenheit . But is this intensification rate an indication of how global warming is altering the characteristics and behavior of nature 's most powerful storms ? That 's a harder question to answer at this point , scientists told Mashable . Kerry Emanuel , a hurricane expert at MIT , said the lack of a consistent record of eastern Pacific storms using hurricane hunter flights makes it difficult to determine if there is a global warming - related trend in such storms . Such flights are typically flown in the Atlantic and only occasionally in the eastern Pacific , so this was an exceptional case . "" There is no question that this is an exceptionally intense tropical cyclone , "" he wrote . "" But I wonder whether we really know that prior storms in the region have not been equally intense and we are just lucky to have measured this one . "" Global warming considerations Maue , for his part , said hurricanes tend to respond to more localized conditions when intensifying or weakening , rather than global trends . "" Hurricanes respond locally , and rapid / explosive intensification changes due to climate change could be a result but hard to say with just one storm during a strong El Niño , "" he wrote . Kevin Trenberth , a senior climate researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado , said the unusually mild ocean temperatures are allowing more moisture to flow into the storm , which adds fuel to the fire . Trenberth 's research has shown that global warming has increased the available water vapor for storms around the world , which plays a role in everything from more intense local downpours to hurricanes . "" The moisture flowing into the storm , that provides its primary fuel , must be higher than it has ever been before , "" he wrote .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/the-australian-commentary-by-ian-plimer-relies-on-false-claims-to-make-its-case/,"Bill Shorten and his allies , the Greens economic vandals , believe climate change is a moral issue . So is telling the truth . With his elite private school education , the Oppo­s­i­tion Leader would have learned about the Roman Warming , the Dark Ages , the Medieval Warming and the Little Ice Age . These took place before industrialisation and were all driven by changes in the sun . He would have learned that ­natural warm times , like now , bring great prosperity , increased longevity and less disease , whereas Jack Frost brings death , depopulation and economic stresses . In biology , the Labor leader would have learned of Darwinism and environmental adapta­tion of species . Humans live on ice and in the hills , valleys , tropics and des­erts , at altitude and on coastal plains . Like countless other organ­isms , we move and adapt when the environment changes . Species thrive when it is warm . From his education at a relig­ious school , he would have learned about the apostle Thomas . One of the strengths of our Western civilisation is doubt and scepticism . Surely Shorten does not believe the catastrophism promoted by green activists and self - interested alleged experts at the expense of the nation . If he does , he is unelectable . If he is knowingly promoting a falsehood , he is unelectable . Critical thinking was fundamental to our culture and should be embraced in policy formulation . In school science , Shorten would have learned carbon dioxide is the food of life and without this natural gas , which occurs in space and all planets , there would be no life . He also would understand from his maths lessons that when 3 per cent of total annual global emissions of carbon dioxide are from humans and Australia prod­uces 1.3 per cent of this 3 per cent , then no amount of emissions reductio­n here will have any effect on global climate . A quick search would show him that whenever in the past there was an explosion of plant life , the carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present . If we halve the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere , all life dies . Shorten should know that for thousands of millions of years the Earth has been changing , with cycles­ and one - off events such as an asteroid impact , super - volcano or a supernova explosion . He should know that climate always changes and that the planet would be in serious trouble if it did not . There are cycles of air , water , rocks and continents . There are measurable cycles with the sun , Earth ’s orbit , oceans and moon that drive climate change , especially if cycles coincide . It has yet to be demonstrated that the climate change today is any different from those of the past . Despite hundreds of billions of dollars of expenditure during the past few decades , it still has not been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive ­global warming . Yet wind and solar industrial complexes pepper the landscape allegedly to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . They run on subsidies , not the wind or the sun . Wind and solar are transfering money from the poor to the rich , not saving the environment . These subsidies , paid by the long - suffering consumer and employer , add to emissions because coal - fired elec­tricity needs to be on standby for when there is no wind or sunshine . The amount of energy used to construct solar and wind facilities is greater than they produce in their working lives . The amount of carbon dioxide released during construction and maintenance is far more than is saved . Renew­ables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area , slice and dice birds and bats , kill insects that are bird food , create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them , leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape . Union superannuation funds have invested massively in renewable energy . Labor ’s promise of 50 per cent renewables will cost electricity consumers hundreds of billions but will benefit the unions . As soon as renewables were introduced into the grid , electric­ity prices increased and delivery became unreliable . Increased elec­tric­ity costs have created unemployment , and many pensioners and the poor can not afford electricity . An increase in renewables will make matters worse . Does Shorten ’s energy policy consider those who lose jobs and have the power cut off in his race to achieve 50 per cent renewables to fill the pockets of Labor union mates ? And what about the scams siphoning off tens of billions that slosh around the world as carbon credits , carbon trading and renewable energy certificates ? Rather than take this money from the poor via higher electricity prices , it would be better spent at home . To smugly claim that valid questions about energy costs are dumb or deceitful is a loud warning bell . Shorten refuses to tell us how he will spend our money or to give any detail on energy ­systems that are proven failures . It is our money and , if he will not give us the financial details , we should be very scared of his shiftiness . I have never written a blank cheque for a used car .","['Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Inaccurate']"

Climate change is happening . It ’s just not the end of the world . It ’s not even our most serious environmental problem . I may seem like a strange person to be saying all of this . I have been a climate activist for 20 years and an environmentalist for 30 . But as an energy expert asked by Congress to provide objective expert testimony , and invited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) to serve as Expert Reviewer of its next Assessment Report , I feel an obligation to apologize for how badly we environmentalists have misled the public . Here are some facts few people know : Humans are not causing a “ sixth mass extinction ” The Amazon is not “ the lungs of the world ” Climate change is not making natural disasters worse Fires have declined 25 % around the world since 2003 The amount of land we use for meat — humankind ’s biggest use of land — has declined by an area nearly as large as Alaska The build - up of wood fuel and more houses near forests , not climate change , explain why there are more , and more dangerous , fires in Australia and California Carbon emissions have been declining in rich nations for decades and peaked in Britain , Germany and France in the mid - seventies Adapting to life below sea level made the Netherlands rich not poor We produce 25 % more food than we need and food surpluses will continue to rise as the world gets hotter Habitat loss and the direct killing of wild animals are bigger threats to species than climate change Wood fuel is far worse for people and wildlife than fossil fuels Preventing future pandemics requires more not less “ industrial ” agriculture I know that the above facts will sound like “ climate denialism ” to many people . But that just shows the power of climate alarmism . In reality , the above facts come from the best - available scientific studies , including those conducted by or accepted by the IPCC , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) , the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) and other leading scientific bodies . Some people will , when they read this imagine that I ’m some right - wing anti - environmentalist . I ’m not . At 17 , I lived in Nicaragua to show solidarity with the Sandinista socialist revolution . At 23 I raised money for Guatemalan women ’s cooperatives . In my early 20s I lived in the semi - Amazon doing research with small farmers fighting land invasions . At 26 I helped expose poor conditions at Nike factories in Asia . I became an environmentalist at 16 when I threw a fundraiser for Rainforest Action Network . At 27 I helped save the last unprotected ancient redwoods in California . In my 30s I advocated renewables and successfully helped persuade the Obama administration to invest $ 90 billion into them . Over the last few years I helped save enough nuclear plants from being replaced by fossil fuels to prevent a sharp increase in emissions Until last year , I mostly avoided speaking out against the climate scare . Partly that ’s because I was embarrassed . After all , I am as guilty of alarmism as any other environmentalist . For years , I referred to climate change as an “ existential ” threat to human civilization , and called it a “ crisis . ” But mostly I was scared . I remained quiet about the climate disinformation campaign because I was afraid of losing friends and funding . The few times I summoned the courage to defend climate science from those who misrepresent it I suffered harsh consequences . And so I mostly stood by and did next to nothing as my fellow environmentalists terrified the public . I even stood by as people in the White House and many in the news media tried to destroy the reputation and career of an outstanding scientist , good man , and friend of mine , Roger Pielke , Jr. , a lifelong progressive Democrat and environmentalist who testified in favor of carbon regulations . Why did they do that ? Because his research proves natural disasters are n’t getting worse . But then , last year , things spiraled out of control . Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez said “ The world is going to end in twelve years if we do n’t address climate change . ” Britain ’s most high - profile environmental group claimed “ Climate Change Kills Children . ” The world ’s most influential green journalist , Bill McKibben , called climate change the “ greatest challenge humans have ever faced ” and said it would “ wipe out civilizations . ” Mainstream journalists reported , repeatedly , that the Amazon was “ the lungs of the world , ” and that deforestation was like a nuclear bomb going off . As a result , half of the people surveyed around the world last year said they thought climate change would make humanity extinct . And in January , one out of five British children told pollsters they were having nightmares about climate change . Whether or not you have children you must see how wrong this is . I admit I may be sensitive because I have a teenage daughter . After we talked about the science she was reassured . But her friends are deeply misinformed and thus , understandably , frightened . I thus decided I had to speak out . I knew that writing a few articles would n’t be enough . I needed a book to properly lay out all of the evidence . And so my formal apology for our fear - mongering comes in the form of my new book , Apocalypse Never : Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/atlantic-ocean-circulation-system-is-slowing-down-as-accurately-described-in-the-new-york-times-article/,"IT ’S ONE OF THE MIGHTIEST RIVERS you will never see , carrying some 30 times more water than all the world ’s freshwater rivers combined . In the North Atlantic , one arm of the Gulf Stream breaks toward Iceland , transporting vast amounts of warmth far northward , by one estimate supplying Scandinavia with heat equivalent to 78,000 times its current energy use . Without this current — a heat pump on a planetary scale — scientists believe that great swaths of the world might look quite different . Now , a spate of studies , including one published last week , suggests this northern portion of the Gulf Stream and the deep ocean currents it ’s connected to may be slowing . Pushing the bounds of oceanography , scientists have slung necklace - like sensor arrays across the Atlantic to better understand the complex network of currents that the Gulf Stream belongs to , not only at the surface , but hundreds of feet deep . “ We ’re all wishing it ’s not true , ” Peter de Menocal , a paleoceanographer and president and director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , said of the changing ocean currents . “ Because if that happens , it ’s just a monstrous change . ” The consequences could include faster sea level rise along parts of the Eastern United States and parts of Europe , stronger hurricanes barreling into the Southeastern United States , and perhaps most ominously , reduced rainfall across the Sahel , a semi - arid swath of land running the width of Africa that is already a geopolitical tinderbox . The scientists ’ concern stems from their understanding of thousands of years of the prehistoric climate record . In the past , a great weakening or even shutdown of this arm of the Gulf Stream seems to have triggered rapid changes in temperatures and precipitation patterns around the North Atlantic and beyond . The northern arm of the Gulf Stream is but one tentacle of a larger , ocean - spanning tangle of currents called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation , or AMOC . Scientists have strong evidence from ice and sediment cores that the AMOC has weakened and shut down before in the past 13,000 years . As a result , mean temperatures in parts of Europe may have rapidly dropped to about 15 degrees Celsius below today ’s averages , ushering in arctic like conditions . Parts of northern Africa and northern South America became much drier . Rainfall may even have declined as far away as what is now China . And some of these changes may have occurred in a matter of decades , maybe less . The AMOC is thus a poster child for the idea of climatic “ tipping points ” — of hard - to - predict thresholds in Earth ’s climate system that , once crossed , have rapid , cascading effects far beyond the corner of the globe where they occur . “ It ’s a switch , ” said Dr. de Menocal , and one that can be thrown quickly . Which brings us to the cold blob . Almost everywhere around the world , average temperatures are rising — except southeast of Greenland where a large patch of the North Atlantic has become colder in recent years . In short , the cold blob may signal that the northern arm of the Gulf Stream no longer arrives with the same strength to the North Atlantic . That a warming atmosphere has , paradoxically , cooled one part of the world . The science remains relatively new , and not everyone agrees the AMOC is actually slowing . But in both scientific modeling of climate change and in the prehistoric record , a North Atlantic cooling presages a shutdown of the current . “ One of the hallmarks of a shutdown is this cold blob , ” says Dr. de Menocal . “ The cold blob is a big deal . ” IN 1513 , THE SPANISH EXPLORER Juan Ponce de León noticed something bizarre off the coast of today ’s Florida : Relentless currents pushing his ships backward , overpowering the winds blowing them forward . He became the first European to describe the Gulf Stream . Benjamin Franklin finally mapped it in the late 1700s — he named it the “ Gulf Stream ” — by measuring changes in water temperature on a return trip from England . Over the 20th century , oceanographers came to realize that the northern branch of the Gulf Stream was part of a gigantic loop of water , with warm surface water flowing north and colder water returning south , deep below the surface . This was the network of currents that scientists now call the AMOC . The system was driven by North Atlantic water that , as it lost heat to the atmosphere and grew dense , sank to the ocean ’s depths , pulling warmer surface water northward . In the middle part of the century , oceanographer Henry Stommel elucidated the physics of how the AMOC could change . His insight was that , depending on the balance of heat and salinity , the sinking effect — called “ overturning”—could strengthen , or weaken , or maybe stop completely . In the 1980s , Wallace Broecker , a geochemist at Columbia University ’s Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory , pounced on that idea . Colleagues studying ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet were seeing evidence of strange climatic “ flickers ” in the past . As Earth warmed from the deep freeze of the last ice age , which peaked around 22,000 years ago , temperatures would rise , then abruptly fall , then rise again just as swiftly . Dr. Broecker theorized this was caused by stops and starts in what he called the ocean ’s “ great conveyor belt ” — the AMOC . The clearest example began about 12,800 years ago . Glaciers that had once covered much of North America and Europe had retreated considerably , and the world was almost out of the deep freeze .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/wall-street-journal-article-repeats-multiple-incorrect-and-misleading-claims-made-in-steven-koonins-new-book-unsettled-steven-koonin/,"Physicist Steven Koonin kicks the hornet ’s nest right out of the gate in “ Unsettled . ” In the book ’s first sentences he asserts that “ the Science ” about our planet ’s climate is anything but “ settled . ” Mr. Koonin knows well that it is nonetheless a settled subject in the minds of most pundits and politicians and most of the population . Further proof of the public ’s sentiment : Earlier this year the United Nations Development Programme published the mother of all climate surveys , titled “ The Peoples ’ Climate Vote . ” With more than a million respondents from 50 countries , the survey , unsurprisingly , found “ 64 % of people said that climate change was an emergency . ” But science itself is not conducted by polls , regardless of how often we are urged to heed a “ scientific consensus ” on climate . As the science - trained novelist Michael Crichton summarized in a famous 2003 lecture at Caltech : “ If it ’s consensus , it is n’t science . If it ’s science , it is n’t consensus . Period . ” Mr. Koonin says much the same in “ Unsettled . ” The book is no polemic . It ’s a plea for understanding how scientists extract clarity from complexity . And , as Mr. Koonin makes clear , few areas of science are as complex and multidisciplinary as the planet ’s climate . He begins with a kind of trigger warning for readers who may be shocked by the book ’s contradiction of four points of climate orthodoxy : “ Heat waves in the US are now no more common than they were in 1900 ” and “ the warmest temperatures in the US have not risen in the past fifty years . . . . Humans have had no detectable impact on hurricanes over the past century . . . . Greenland ’s ice sheet is n’t shrinking any more rapidly today than it was eighty years ago . . . . The net economic impact of human - induced climate change will be minimal through at least the end of this century . ” But Mr. Koonin is no “ climate denier , ” to use the concocted phrase used to shut down debate . The word “ denier ” is of course meant to associate skeptics of climate alarmism with Holocaust deniers . Mr. Koonin finds this label particularly abhorrent , since “ the Nazis killed more than two hundred of my relatives in Eastern Europe . ” As for “ denying , ” Mr. Koonin makes it clear , on the book ’s first page , that “ it ’s true that the globe is warming , and that humans are exerting a warming influence upon it . ” The heart of the science debate , however , is n’t about whether the globe is warmer or whether humanity contributed . The important questions are about the magnitude of civilization ’s contribution and the speed of changes ; and , derivatively , about the urgency and scale of governmental response . Mr. Koonin thinks most readers will be surprised at what the data show . I dare say they will . As Mr Koonin illustrates , tornado frequency and severity are also not trending up ; nor are the number and severity of droughts . The extent of global fires has been trending significantly downward . The rate of sea - level rise has not accelerated . Global crop yields are rising , not falling . And while global atmospheric CO2 levels are obviously higher now than two centuries ago , they ’re not at any record planetary high — they’re at a low that has only been seen once before in the past 500 million years . Mr. Koonin laments the sloppiness of those using local weather “ events ” to make claims about long - cycle planetary phenomena . He chastises not so much local news media as journalists with prestigious national media who should know better . This attribution error evokes one of Mr. Koonin ’s rare rebukes : “ Pointing to hurricanes as an example of the ravages of human - caused climate change is at best unconvincing , and at worst plainly dishonest . ” When it comes to the vaunted computer models , Mr. Koonin is persuasively skeptical . It ’s a big problem , he says , when models ca n’t retroactively “ predict ” events that have already happened . And he notes that some of the “ tuning ” done to models so that they work better amounts to “ cooking the books . ” He should know , having written one of the first textbooks on using computers to model physics phenomena . Mr. Koonin ’s science credentials are impeccable — unlike , say , those of one well - known Swedish teenager to whom the media affords great attention on climate matters . He has been a professor of physics at Caltech and served as the top scientist in Barack Obama ’s Energy Department . The book is copiously referenced and relies on widely accepted government documents . Since all the data that Mr. Koonin uses are available to others , he poses the obvious question : “ Why have n’t you heard these facts before ? ” He is cautious , perhaps overly so , in proposing the causes for so much misinformation . He points to such things as incentives to invoke alarm for fundraising purposes and official reports that “ mislead by omission . ” Many of the primary scientific reports , he observes repeatedly , are factual . Still , “ the public gets their climate information almost exclusively from the media ; very few people actually read the assessment summaries . ” Mr. Koonin says that he knows he ’ll be criticized , even “ attacked . ” You ca n’t blame him for taking a few pages to shadow box with his critics . But even if one remains unconvinced by his arguments , the right response is to debate the science . We ’ll see if that happens in a world in which politicians assert the science is settled and plan astronomical levels of spending to replace the nation ’s massive infrastructures with “ green ” alternatives .","['Misleading', 'Inaccurate']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/npr-story-accurately-describes-ecological-consequences-of-altered-spring-timings-in-a-warming-climate-nathan-rott/,"There 's a cycle that starts when the snow melts and the earth thaws high in Colorado 's Rocky Mountains . It 's a seasonal cycle based on timing and temperature , two variables that climate change is pushing increasingly out of sync . To the outsider , it can be hard to see : Plants still grow , flowers bud , bears awake , and marmots breed . Broad - tailed hummingbirds still trill around a landscape that evokes the opening scene of The Sound of Music , with flowery meadows and granite peaks . But those who know this ecosystem will tell you something is a little off . The flowers are blooming earlier . The marmots are mating in early May. Spring is springing sooner across the Northern Hemisphere , changing natural cycles around the world . In Alaska , brown bears are changing their feeding habits to eat elderberries that ripen earlier . In California , birds are nesting and breeding a week earlier than they did a century ago . "" One of the consequences of climate change is that even though everything is happening earlier , they 're not changing at the same rate , "" says David Inouye , an ecologist from the University of Maryland who has spent more than 40 years documenting the change in Colorado 's alpine meadows . The results can be seen all around him . Flowers are blooming before there are bees to pollinate them . Hard frosts are still occurring long after winter 's snow melts away , decimating fruit orchards and budding plants . Allergy season is getting longer . Inouye says that when he started spending his summers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Gothic , Colo. , cataloging flowers in the thin mountain air , climate change was n't really a thing people were talking about . But as time went on , the evidence of it started to become unavoidable . "" Temperatures are getting warmer here , "" he says . "" The April low temperatures here are now about 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they used to be . "" Some plants and wildlife , taking their thermal cue , have been able to adapt in kind . Some are thriving . Others are being left behind . Fewer flowers , fewer worker bees Colorado 's snowpack this year was the worst it had been in more than 30 years . Temperatures in early spring soared . Many researchers here view this as a glimpse of things to come . "" You can see it visually , "" says Rebecca Irwin , an ecologist from North Carolina State University . "" We have less flowers . "" Fewer flowers means less food for the native bees that buzz around in meadows like the one Irwin stands in . She and two others are equipped with wispy butterfly nets and fanny packs filled with plastic vials . They 're hoping to get an idea of how different bees are doing in this environment by catching as many of them as they can over the course of an hour . It is a task that proves easy . With lunges and hops , they catch sweat bees and leafcutter bees , queens and workers . At the end of the time period , it 's clear that they caught far fewer worker bees than they would have in a normal year . "" It 's hard to know if they 're just delayed or if they 're not doing well because there 's no food for them , "" Irwin says . Some bees , Irwin says , seem to be doing fine . In years like this , they 're able to emerge earlier to meet the early bloom . "" But some of them are constrained by how long it takes them to develop , "" she says . The fear is that those bees and the flowers that depend on them for pollination could slowly get pushed out . Michael Stemkovski of North Carolina State says documenting these changes can be disheartening . "" It 's kind of like watching an illness progress without having the tools to remedy it . "" We may not like the climate change winners The ability of a species to adapt to its circumstances — to roll with the environmental punches , so to speak — is called plasticity . Species that have a lot of plasticity tend to be generalists . They 're able to make the situation work . Species with less plasticity , those that depend on a specific ecosystem or climate , are more likely to struggle . "" When you think of a plant that ca n't move over its lifetime , it either tolerates a dry area or it does n't , "" says Dan Blumstein , a conservation biologist from the University of California , Los Angeles . He specializes in marmots , a large ground squirrel that is , in Blumstein 's words , "" remarkably plastic . "" "" Marmots are all about getting obese , "" Blumstein says . "" They adjust their annual schedule appropriately to be active when the vegetation is growing . "" An earlier spring means a longer growing season , so they have more time to gather food . As a result , Blumstein says , marmots seem to be getting bigger . He stops short of calling them a "" climate change winner "" though , noting that a longer growing season also means more chances for them to be killed by predators . Other species are emerging as winners though , including "" some that people might not be very fond of , "" says Jill Anderson , a geneticist at the University of Georgia . She points to poison ivy , which is expected to thrive with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . Researchers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory also report seeing far more ticks this summer than in any previous year . That report is consistent with studies showing that the range for ticks is increasing with a warming climate .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/rolling-stone-eric-holthaus-point-of-no-return-climate-change-nightmares/,"Historians may look to 2015 as the year when shit really started hitting the fan . Some snapshots : In just the past few months , record - setting heat waves in Pakistan and India each killed more than 1,000 people . In Washington state ’s Olympic National Park , the rainforest caught fire for the first time in living memory . London reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit during the hottest July day ever recorded in the U.K. ; The Guardian briefly had to pause its live blog of the heat wave because its computer servers overheated . In California , suffering from its worst drought in a millennium , a 50 - acre brush fire swelled seventyfold in a matter of hours , jumping across the I-15 freeway during rush - hour traffic . Then , a few days later , the region was pounded by intense , virtually unheard - of summer rains . Puerto Rico is under its strictest water rationing in history as a monster El Niño forms in the tropical Pacific Ocean , shifting weather patterns worldwide . On July 20th , James Hansen , the former NASA climatologist who brought climate change to the public ’s attention in the summer of 1988 , issued a bombshell : He and a team of climate scientists had identified a newly important feedback mechanism off the coast of Antarctica that suggests mean sea levels could rise 10 times faster than previously predicted : 10 feet by 2065 . The authors included this chilling warning : If emissions are n’t cut , “ We conclude that multi - meter sea - level rise would become practically unavoidable . Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea - level rise could be devastating . It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable , threatening the fabric of civilization . ” Eric Rignot , a climate scientist at NASA and the University of California - Irvine and a co - author on Hansen ’s study , said their new research does n’t necessarily change the worst - case scenario on sea - level rise , it just makes it much more pressing to think about and discuss , especially among world leaders . In particular , says Rignot , the new research shows a two - degree Celsius rise in global temperature — the previously agreed upon “ safe ” level of climate change — “ would be a catastrophe for sea - level rise . ” Hansen ’s new study also shows how complicated and unpredictable climate change can be . Even as global ocean temperatures rise to their highest levels in recorded history , some parts of the ocean , near where ice is melting exceptionally fast , are actually cooling , slowing ocean circulation currents and sending weather patterns into a frenzy . Sure enough , a persistently cold patch of ocean is starting to show up just south of Greenland , exactly where previous experimental predictions of a sudden surge of freshwater from melting ice expected it to be . Michael Mann , another prominent climate scientist , recently said of the unexpectedly sudden Atlantic slowdown , “ This is yet another example of where observations suggest that climate model predictions may be too conservative when it comes to the pace at which certain aspects of climate change are proceeding . ” Since storm systems and jet streams in the United States and Europe partially draw their energy from the difference in ocean temperatures , the implication of one patch of ocean cooling while the rest of the ocean warms is profound . Storms will get stronger , and sea - level rise will accelerate . Scientists like Hansen only expect extreme weather to get worse in the years to come , though Mann said it was still “ unclear ” whether recent severe winters on the East Coast are connected to the phenomenon . And yet , these are n’t even the most disturbing changes happening to the Earth ’s biosphere that climate scientists are discovering this year . For that , you have to look not at the rising sea levels but to what is actually happening within the oceans themselves . Water temperatures this year in the North Pacific have never been this high for this long over such a large area — and it is already having a profound effect on marine life .

On an excursion earlier this year , Thomas spotted 25 humpbacks and three blue whales . During a survey on July 4th , federal officials spotted 115 whales in a single hour near the Farallon Islands — enough to issue a boating warning . Humpbacks are occasionally seen offshore in California , but rarely so close to the coast or in such numbers . Why are they coming so close to shore ? Exceptionally warm water has concentrated the krill and anchovies they feed on into a narrow band of relatively cool coastal water . The whales are having a heyday . “ It ’s unbelievable , ” Thomas told a local paper . “ Whales are all over the place . ” Last fall , in northern Alaska , in the same part of the Arctic where Shell is planning to drill for oil , federal scientists discovered 35,000 walruses congregating on a single beach . It was the largest - ever documented “ haul out ” of walruses , and a sign that sea ice , their favored habitat , is becoming harder and harder to find . Marine life is moving north , adapting in real time to the warming ocean . Great white sharks have been sighted breeding near Monterey Bay , California , the farthest north that ’s ever been known to occur . A blue marlin was caught last summer near Catalina Island — 1,000 miles north of its typical range . Across California , there have been sightings of non - native animals moving north , such as Mexican red crabs .",['Alarmist']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/science-about-links-between-global-warming-and-massive-heat-waves-chris-mooney-washington-post/,"The United States is witnessing a massive , dangerous heat wave , as a huge system of high pressure covers the central part of the country . It ’s a big enough deal that yesterday President Obama even tweeted about it , including a map showing the maximum heat index in some parts of the Midwest and Southeast reaching 110 or 115 degrees on Saturday . Here in Washington , temperatures could break 100 degrees Friday or over the weekend . This will , inevitably , lead to much talk of climate change in the coming days . So it ’s important to separate the scientific wheat from the chaff and figure out what science can , and ca n’t , reliably say about the link between an event like this and a warming planet — especially in a year that , on a global scale , has shattered past temperature records for six out of the last six months . And the gist is that when it comes to extreme heat waves in general — heat waves that appear out of the norm in some way , for instance in their intensity , frequency , or duration — while scientists never say individual events are “ caused ” by climate change , they are getting less and less circumspect about making some connection . “ As predictable as the sunrise , some will say heat waves always happened , ” said Marshall Shepherd , director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia and former president of the American Meteorological Society . “ Yep , so did home runs in baseball , but the steroid era brought more and longer home runs . A new National Academies study suggests that ‘ heat waves ’ may be one of the primary climate change markers like home runs were in baseball . ” In other words , when a planet warms , the odds shift in favor of more intense or long lasting heat waves . That ’s just plain logic . Indeed , the National Academy of Sciences report in question notes that , “ Confidence in attribution findings of anthropogenic influence is greatest for those extreme events that are related to an aspect of temperature , such as the observed long - term warming of the region or global climate , where there is little doubt that human activities have caused an observed change . ” “ In particular , for extreme heat and cold events , changes in long - term mean conditions provide a basis for expecting that there should also be changes in extreme conditions . ” And we ’ve definitely already had changes in not only “ long - term mean conditions , ” but in heat waves themselves . The U.S. National Climate Assessment found that U.S. heat waves have already “ become more frequent and intense , ” that the U.S. is shattering high temperature records far more frequently than it is shattering low temperature records ( just as you ’d expect ) , and that it is seeing correspondingly fewer cold spells . As for future projections , meanwhile , the assessment added that “ Climate models project that the same summertime temperatures that ranked among the hottest 5 % in 1950 - 1979 will occur at least 70 % of the time by 2035 - 2064 in the U.S. if global emissions of heat - trapping gases continue to grow . ” However , pointing all of this out is not the same as making a specific attribution for this specific heat event — rather , it is saying that attribution can be made for this class or type of event . Beyond that , specific attribution requires active research , and an attention to the actual temperatures , duration and other aspects of the weather phenomenon . That ’s because , as Shepherd notes , there are always heat waves , even in a stable climate . Typically , in such an attribution study , scientists will use sets of climate models — one set including the factors that drive human global warming and the other including purely “ natural ” factors — and see if an event like the one in question is more likely to occur in the first set of models . Researchers are getting better and better at performing these kinds of studies fast , in near real time . So do n’t be at all surprised if we see such a study for the current heat wave event — just as we saw for , most recently , the devastating bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef , which was tied to an extreme marine heatwave off Australia ’s northeastern coast . But in the meantime , some scientists and experts are n’t holding back . “ With every heat wave , probably the number one question is , is it climate change , or is it not ? Well the answer is , it ’s both , ” said Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe on a press call Thursday . “ We get heat waves naturally , but climate change is amping them up , it ’s giving them that extra energy , to make them even more serious , and have even greater impacts . ” Hayhoe did n’t attempt a specific attribution of the current heat wave , any more than Shepherd did . Rather , she ’s once again articulating the general connection . “ We are not used to having heat waves that are extreme as the ones we see today , ” she said . It ’s important to underscore , as Hayhoe did , that this event poses severe risks to health — particularly for children and the elderly — and also to crops across the U.S. heartland . She pointed to an extreme 2003 heat wave that affected Paris and Europe , and which has indeed been connected to climate change through statistical attribution analysis . That event killed hundreds of people in Paris and London , and a recent study attributed at least some of those deaths , themselves , to climate change . So these links are real , if not always simple to characterize .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/great-barrier-reef-coral-climate-change-dieoff-the-new-york-times-damien-cave-justin-gillis/,"SYDNEY , Australia — The Great Barrier Reef in Australia has long been one of the world ’s most magnificent natural wonders , so enormous it can be seen from space , so beautiful it can move visitors to tears . But the reef , and the profusion of sea creatures living near it , are in profound trouble . Huge sections of the Great Barrier Reef , stretching across hundreds of miles of its most pristine northern sector , were recently found to be dead , killed last year by overheated seawater . More southerly sections around the middle of the reef that barely escaped then are bleaching now , a potential precursor to another die - off that could rob some of the reef ’s most visited areas of color and life . “ We did n’t expect to see this level of destruction to the Great Barrier Reef for another 30 years , ” said Terry P. Hughes , director of a government - funded center for coral reef studies at James Cook University in Australia and the lead author of a paper on the reef that is being published Thursday as the cover article of the journal Nature . “ In the north , I saw hundreds of reefs — literally two - thirds of the reefs were dying and are now dead . ” The damage to the Great Barrier Reef , one of the world ’s largest living structures , is part of a global calamity that has been unfolding intermittently for nearly two decades and seems to be intensifying . In the paper , dozens of scientists described the recent disaster as the third worldwide mass bleaching of coral reefs since 1998 , but by far the most widespread and damaging . The state of coral reefs is a telling sign of the health of the seas . Their distress and death are yet another marker of the ravages of global climate change . If most of the world ’s coral reefs die , as scientists fear is increasingly likely , some of the richest and most colorful life in the ocean could be lost , along with huge sums from reef tourism . In poorer countries , lives are at stake : Hundreds of millions of people get their protein primarily from reef fish , and the loss of that food supply could become a humanitarian crisis . With this latest global bleaching in its third year , reef scientists say they have no doubt as to the responsible party . They warned decades ago that the coral reefs would be at risk if human society kept burning fossil fuels at a runaway pace , releasing greenhouse gases that warm the ocean . Emissions continued to rise , and now the background ocean temperature is high enough that any temporary spike poses a critical risk to reefs . “ Climate change is not a future threat , ” Professor Hughes said . “ On the Great Barrier Reef , it ’s been happening for 18 years . ” Corals require warm water to thrive , but they are exquisitely sensitive to extra heat . Just two or three degrees Fahrenheit of excess warming can sometimes kill the tiny creatures . Globally , the ocean has warmed by about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century , by a conservative calculation , and a bit more in the tropics , home to many reefs . An additional kick was supplied by an El Niño weather pattern that peaked in 2016 and temporarily warmed much of the surface of the planet , causing the hottest year in a historical record dating to 1880 . It was obvious last year that the corals on many reefs were likely to die , but now formal scientific assessments are coming in . The paper in Nature documents vast coral bleaching in 2016 along a 500 - mile section of the reef north of Cairns , a city on Australia ’s eastern coast . Bleaching indicates that corals are under heat stress , but they do not always die and cooler water can help them recover . Subsequent surveys of the Great Barrier Reef , conducted late last year after the deadline for inclusion in the Nature paper , documented that extensive patches of reef had in fact died , and would not be likely to recover soon , if at all . Professor Hughes led those surveys . He said that he and his students cried when he showed them maps of the damage , which he had calculated in part by flying low in small planes and helicopters . His aerial surveys , combined with underwater measurements , found that 67 percent of the corals had died in a long stretch north of Port Douglas , and in patches , the mortality reached 83 percent . By luck , a storm stirred the waters in the central and southern parts of the reef at a critical moment , cooling them , and mortality there was much lower — about 6 percent in a stretch off Townsville , and even lower in the southernmost part of the reef . But an Australian government study released last week found that over all , last year brought “ the highest sea surface temperatures across the Great Barrier Reef on record . ” Only 9 percent of the reef has avoided bleaching since 1998 , Professor Hughes said , and now , the less remote , more heavily visited stretch from Cairns south is in trouble again . Water temperatures there remain so high that another round of mass bleaching is underway , the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority confirmed last week . Professor Hughes said he hoped the die - off this time would not be as serious as last year ’s , but “ back - to - back bleaching is unheard - of in Australia . ” The central and southern part of the reef had already been badly damaged by human activities like dredging and pollution .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scientists-we-know-what-really-causes-climate-james-barrett-the-daily-wire/,"Anew study produced by a University of Wisconsin - Madison geoscientist and Northwestern astrophysicist presents an explanation of the fluctuations of the earth 's temperatures that global warming alarmists are going to make sure to bury : The cycle of changes in the climate over the millennia is a result of changes in the amount of solar radiation , in part caused by small changes in the orbits of Earth and Mars . While the notion that the impact on earth 's orbital cycle on solar radiation levels is the most significant factor determining global temperatures is anything but new , the team of scientists seem to have tied the phenomenon to planetary orbits in a more concrete manner than previous studies . In an article summarizing the scientists ' findings , which were originally published this week in the journal Nature , the University of Wisconsin - Madison notes that the study "" provides the first hard proof for what scientists call the ' chaotic solar system , ' a theory proposed in 1989 to account for small variations in the present conditions of the solar system . "" Those variations over millions of years "" produce big changes in our planet ’s climate . "" Not only does the new discovery promise to provide a better understanding of "" the mechanics of the solar system , "" but also "" a better understanding of the link between orbital variations and climate change over geologic time scales . "" UW - M provides some more details on the groundbreaking study : Using evidence from alternating layers of limestone and shale laid down over millions of years in a shallow North American seaway at the time dinosaurs held sway on Earth , the team led by UW – Madison Professor of Geoscience Stephen Meyers and Northwestern University Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences Brad Sageman discovered the 87 million - year - old signature of a “ resonance transition ” between Mars and Earth . A resonance transition is the consequence of the “ butterfly effect ” in chaos theory . It plays on the idea that small changes in the initial conditions of a nonlinear system can have large effects over time . In the context of the solar system , the phenomenon occurs when two orbiting bodies periodically tug at one another , as occurs when a planet in its track around the sun passes in relative proximity to another planet in its own orbit . These small but regular ticks in a planet ’s orbit can exert big changes on the location and orientation of a planet on its axis relative to the sun and , accordingly , change the amount of solar radiation a planet receives over a given area . Where and how much solar radiation a planet gets is a key driver of climate . Over the ages , the subtle variations in the orbits of Earth and Mars , the scientists theorize , have impacted the amount of Earth 's exposure to solar radiation and thus led to shifts in global temperatures and impacting the pattern of Earth 's ice ages . "" The impact of astronomical cycles on climate can be quite large , "" explains Meyers , noting as an example the pacing of the Earth ’s ice ages , which have been reliably matched to periodic changes in the shape of Earth ’s orbit , and the tilt of our planet on its axis . While evidence that the earth 's orbital variations impact radiation levels and thus global temperatures does not of course mean that man is not in some way impacting the climate , studies like these highlight that the role man plays on the planet is dwarfed by natural phenomena utterly out of our control .","['Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Inappropriate_sources']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/bbc-article-ocean-acidification-accurate-brief-roger-harrabin/,"All sea life will be affected because carbon dioxide emissions from modern society are making the oceans more acidic , a major new report will say . The eight - year study from more than 250 scientists finds that infant sea creatures will be especially harmed . This means the number of baby cod growing to adulthood could fall to a quarter or even a 12th of today 's numbers , the researchers suggest . The assessment comes from the BIOACID project , which is led from Germany . A brochure summarising the main outcomes will be presented to climate negotiators at their annual meeting , which this year is taking place in Bonn in November . The Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification report authors say some creatures may benefit directly from the chemical changes - but even these could still be adversely affected indirectly by shifts in the whole food web . What is more , the research shows that changes through acidification will be made worse by climate change , pollution , coastal development , over - fishing and agricultural fertilisers . Ocean acidification is happening because as CO2 from fossil fuels dissolves in seawater , it produces carbonic acid and this lowers the pH of the water . Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution , the average pH of global ocean surface waters have fallen from pH 8.2 to 8.1 . This represents an increase in acidity of about 26 % . The study 's lead author is Prof Ulf Riebesell from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel . He is a world authority on the topic and has typically communicated cautiously about the effects of acidification . He told BBC News : "" Acidification affects marine life across all groups , although to different degrees . "" Warm - water corals are generally more sensitive than cold - water corals . Clams and snails are more sensitive than crustaceans . "" And we found that early life stages are generally more affected than adult organisms . "" But even if an organism is n't directly harmed by acidification it may be affected indirectly through changes in its habitat or changes in the food web . "" At the end of the day , these changes will affect the many services the ocean provides to us . "" On the agenda Since 2009 , scientists working under the BIOACID programme have studied how marine creatures are affected by acidification during different life stages ; how these reactions reverberate through the marine food web ; and whether the challenges can be mitigated by evolutionary adaptation . Some research was done in the lab but other studies were conducted in the North Sea , the Baltic , the Arctic , and Papua New Guinea . A synthesis of more than 350 publications on the effects of ocean acidification - which will be given to climate delegates at next month 's summit - reveals that almost half of the marine animal species tested reacted negatively to already moderate increases in seawater CO2 concentrations . Early life stages were affected in Atlantic cod , blue mussels , starfish , sea urchins and sea butterflies . But an experiment with barnacles showed they were not sensitive to acidification . And some plants - like algae which use carbon for photosynthesis - may even benefit . Dr Carol Turley , an ocean acidification expert from Plymouth Marine Labs in the UK described the BIOACID research as enormously important . She told BBC News : "" It 's contributed enormous insights into the impacts that acidification can have on a wide range of marine organisms from microbes to fish . "" It 's also explored how in combination with ocean warming and other stressors it might play out at the ecosystem level and affect human society . "" On the lead - up to the UN climate change negotiations in Bonn this November it is clear that the ocean and its ecosystems should not be ignored .

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/mashable-andrew-freedman-vanuatu-cyclone-pam-climate-change/,"After Category 5 Cyclone Pam tore his country apart , prompting a humanitarian emergency , Vanuatu 's President Baldwin Lonsdale pinned at least part of the blame for the islands ' predicament on manmade global warming . The storm , which struck with a ferocity the country had not experienced before in modern history , had sustained winds of 165 miles per hour , with gusts exceeding 200 miles per hour when it roared through the tiny country . It leveled homes and businesses , and stripped trees bare on the most populated island of Efate , including the capital of Port Vila . The death toll stood at 24 on Tuesday , but it is expected to rise as more information begins streaming in from outlying islands that have been cut off from the outside world . [ seealso url=""http://mashable.com/2014/09/29 / global - warming - making - heat - waves - some - droughts - more - common - studies - find/ "" ] “ This is a very devastating cyclone … I term it a monster that has hit Vanuatu , ” Lonsdale said at a U.N. disaster summit in Japan , according to The Guardian . “ It is a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu . … All the development that has taken place has been wiped out . ” He said the cyclone seasons that the nation had experienced were the result of climate change . “ We see the level of sea rise … the cyclone seasons , the warm , the rain , all this is affected , ” he said . So , is the president correct to link the devastating cyclone to global warming ? Or is the tie so tenuous that it 's almost nonexistent ? The answer , as it often is in climate science , is far more nuanced than Vanuatu 's president portrays it . Scientists say unusually mild sea surface temperatures and added atmospheric water vapor helped the storm intensify before slamming into Vanuatu . At the same time , rising sea levels likely made the storm more damaging than it would have been just a few decades ago . Here are the main factors to consider when analyzing the potential ties between Cyclone Pam and the warming climate . Ocean temperatures are the main suspect Scientists Mashable contacted said the storm intensified rapidly before hitting Vanuatu , aided by an area of unusually mild ocean waters and favorable atmospheric conditions . Ocean temperatures in the area where the cyclone intensified were up to 2 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) . Some -- but not all -- of the sea surface temperature anomalies in the Southwest Pacific Ocean are likely related to global warming , according to Kevin Trenberth , a climate researcher with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado , as well as other experts . According to Trenberth , about about 0.6 degrees Celsius , or 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit , of the ocean temperature anomalies "" can be blamed on human - induced global warming "" while the rest is "" natural "" and associated with an ongoing El Niño event in the tropical Pacific Ocean . El Niño is a climate phenomenon that features warmer than average ocean temperatures in much of the tropical Pacific Ocean . It can alter worldwide weather patterns , including tropical cyclone seasons in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans . Whatever the cause , though , the warm ocean waters can supercharge storms like Cyclone Pam , as more evaporation takes place and moisture is added to the air . "" The atmosphere all around there has some 10 to 20 % more moisture in it than a comparable storm in the 1970s would have had . The high sea surface temperatures and the water vapor fueled the storm and undoubtedly increased its intensity and size , "" Trenberth said in an email conversation . "" The winds are stronger , the storm surge is greater on higher sea levels . "" El Niño "" has played a role here on top of global warming . But strong storms can certainly occur in that region anyway ( but not this strong ) . The sea surface temperatures are over 86 degrees Fahrenheit for heaven 's sake , "" he said . An analysis of long - term trends in sea surface temperatures in the region where Cyclone Pam rapidly intensified into a Category 5 monster shows that there has been a warming trend since 1948 , although there are considerable uncertainties in this data , says Michael Ventrice , an operational meteorologist at WSI Corporation in Massachusetts . He said it is not clear from the data whether the higher temperatures were a result of natural variations or human effects . "" The bottom line point is that there has been a long - term warming trend observed in the location where Pam intensified , "" Ventrice said . Madden and Julian ... Ventrice says Cyclone Pam "" thrived "" in an environment that was well - suited to explosive intensification . These environmental factors included the warm ocean waters that extended deep into the ocean , as well as a natural weather cycle known as the Madden Julian Oscillation , or MJO . In certain instances , the MJO can encourage the air to rise , forming thunderstorms as well as tropical cyclones . Think of the MJO as a helping hand that likely aided the storm 's rapid intensification . "" The MJO acts to moisten the middle and upper - levels of the atmosphere and reduce vertical wind shear , both are which parameters that are musts for intensification , "" Ventrice said .

That 's the potential future of Earth , a new study suggests , noting that global warming could be twice as warm as current climate models predict . The rate of warming is also remarkable : “ The changes we see today are much faster than anything encountered in Earth ’s history . In terms of rate of change , we are in uncharted waters , ” said study co - author Katrin Meissner of the University of New South Wales in Australia . This could mean the landmark Paris Climate Agreement – which seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) above pre - industrial levels – may not be enough to ward off catastrophe . “ Even with just 2 degrees of warming – and potentially just 1.5 degrees – significant impacts on the Earth system are profound , ” said study co - author Alan Mix , a scientist from Oregon State University . “ We can expect that sea - level rise could become unstoppable for millennia , impacting much of the world ’s population , infrastructure and economic activity , ” Mix said . In looking at Earth 's past , scientists can predict what the future will look like . In the study , the researchers looked back at natural global warming periods over the past 3.5 million years and compared them to current man - made warming . By combining a wide range of measurements from ice cores , sediment layers , fossil records , dating using atomic isotopes and many other established paleoclimate methods , the researchers pieced together the impact of those climatic changes . Human - inflicted climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal , oil and gas , which release heat - trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the the atmosphere . Study lead author Hubertus Fischer of the University of Bern in Switzerland and his team found that our current climate predictions may underestimate long - term warming by as much as a factor of two . Meissner said that "" climate models appear to be trustworthy for small changes , such as for low - emission scenarios over short periods , say over the next few decades out to 2100 . But as the change gets larger or more persistent ... it appears they underestimate climate change . "" The research also revealed how large areas of the polar ice caps could collapse and significant changes to ecosystems could see the Sahara Desert become green and the edges of tropical forests turn into fire - dominated savanna . However , Meissner said "" we can not comment on how far in the future these changes will occur . "" Referring to the study findings , lead author Fischer said that without serious reduction in carbon dioxide emissions , there is "" very little margin for error to meet the Paris targets . ” The study , which was conducted by dozens of researchers from 17 countries , was published last week in Nature Geoscience , a peer - reviewed British journal .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/california-dam-crisis-says-changing-climate-noah-diffenbaugh-new-york-times/,"STANFORD , Calif. — After five years of record - setting drought , much of California is being pummeled by an extremely wet winter . The disaster unfolding at Oroville , where precipitation is more than double the average , is the latest reminder that the United States needs a climate - smart upgrade of our water management systems . In the West , much of our water infrastructure is old . Oroville Dam , north of Sacramento , was completed in 1968 , nearly a half a century ago . Other major components of our water system are generations older , and maintenance has not been a priority . The damage to Oroville Dam , where the primary spillway developed a giant gash and the emergency spillway threatened to erode , illustrates the hazard of relying on aging infrastructure to protect us from extreme weather . But age and upkeep are not the only problems . Our water system was designed and built in an old climate , one in which extremely warm years were less common and snowpack was more reliable . Here in the West , we use the same dams and reservoirs for both water storage and flood control , so during the wet season , reservoir managers continuously balance the dual pressures of storing as much water as possible for the dry summer and releasing sufficient water to create room for the next storm . This system relies on the natural reservoir of mountain snowpack , which melts gradually over the spring and summer . While it is well known that much of the West relies on snowpack for water storage , the vital role of snowpack in flood control is considerably less appreciated . When precipitation falls as snow , it stays in the mountains rather than flowing into reservoirs . This leaves more room in reservoirs to prevent flooding downstream during heavy rainfall . The recent drought has highlighted the pressure that a changing climate puts on a snowpack - dependent water system . With the shift toward more rain rather than snow , and the earlier melting of the snowpack , water managers need to release water more frequently for flood control . This dynamic is playing out in Oroville now , with the state ’s water managers racing to empty water from the dam ’s reservoir in advance of storms forecast to arrive Wednesday . Because these storms are relatively warm , they are likely to bring rain to the surrounding mountains , speeding the flow of water behind the dam . The juxtaposition of five years of hot , dry conditions followed by more rain than reservoirs can store may seem incongruous . However , this is exactly what climate scientists have predicted for California since at least the 1980s : protracted periods of warm , dry conditions punctuated by intense wet spells , with more rain and less snow , causing both drought and floods . Recent work from my lab shows that in fact this pattern is already emerging , with the conditions that create extremely warm dry years and extremely wet years both becoming more frequent . The other bitter reality is that this extremely wet winter will not wash away the drought . Depending where one looks , California lost out on one to three full years of precipitation from 2012 to 2016 . That is a lot of water to make up in one year , and as of last week almost half of California was still in a state of drought . The moisture deficits that have accumulated during the drought have not been seen in our lifetimes . They have caused thousands of California residents to go without running water , resulted in groundwater contamination and permanent loss of aquifer storage capacity , and have severely stressed tens of millions of trees . As a result , even after this wet year , rural communities , groundwater aquifers and forest ecosystems will still feel the effects of the drought . As the last five years illustrate , California ’s water system is not equipped for climate change ’s “ new normal . ” That water system must simultaneously provide for the country ’s largest population and agricultural sector , and one of its most diverse natural environments . Although California has greatly improved water - use efficiency in the last half - century , climate change is pushing our water system to the limit . Investments in “ climate smart ” infrastructure can ensure the safety and security of Americans in the face of climate stresses now and in the future . These investments in infrastructure upgrades and expansion would create jobs , protect communities from disasters and help prepare us for changes in the climate . This effort would have several key elements : First , given the new climate normal in which protracted hot , dry periods are far more common , we need to deploy technologies that can increase water supply . While expensive , energy - intensive desalination options have received considerable attention , wastewater recycling technologies have improved to the point that clean , safe water can now be delivered at reduced energy cost and can even be an energy source by using the organic matter in wastewater to produce energy . Investments in infrastructure to capture , store and clean urban storm water will also create new sources of water supply . Second , we need to acknowledge that a water system that relies on snowpack for both water storage and flood control is increasingly risky . To make up for loss of snowpack , we need to build infrastructure that enables us to use excess runoff to recharge groundwater aquifers . This will have the dual benefit of replenishing groundwater that is drawn down during hot dry spells and capturing storm water that is lost when water is released for flood control .",['Sound_reasoning']

"" The first is that limiting warming to 1.5C brings a lot of benefits compared with limiting it to two degrees . It really reduces the impacts of climate change in very important ways , "" said Prof Jim Skea , who co - chairs the IPCC . "" The second is the unprecedented nature of the changes that are required if we are to limit warming to 1.5C - changes to energy systems , changes to the way we manage land , changes to the way we move around with transportation . "" What 's one big takeaway ? "" Scientists might want to write in capital letters , ' ACT NOW , IDIOTS , ' but they need to say that with facts and numbers , "" said Kaisa Kosonen , of Greenpeace , who was an observer at the negotiations . "" And they have . "" The researchers have used these facts and numbers to paint a picture of the world with a dangerous fever , caused by humans . We used to think if we could keep warming below two degrees this century , then the changes we would experience would be manageable . Not any more . This new study says that going past 1.5C is dicing with the planet 's liveability . And the 1.5C temperature "" guard rail "" could be exceeded in just 12 years , in 2030 . We can stay below it - but it will require urgent , large - scale changes from governments and individuals and we will have to invest a massive pile of cash every year , about 2.5 % of global gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the value of all goods and services produced , for two decades . Even then , we will still need machines , trees and plants to capture carbon from the air that we can then store deep underground - forever . What can I do ? The report says there must be rapid and significant changes in four big global systems : energy • land use • cities • industry But it adds that the world can not meet its target without changes by individuals , urging people to : buy less meat , milk , cheese and butter and more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away • drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances • take trains and buses instead of planes • use videoconferencing instead of business travel • use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer • insulate homes • demand low carbon in every consumer product Lifestyle changes can make a big difference , said Dr Debra Roberts , the IPCC 's other co - chair . "" That 's a very empowering message for the individual , "" she said . "" This is not about remote science ; it is about where we live and work , and it gives us a cue on how we might be able to contribute to that massive change , because everyone is going to have to be involved . "" "" You might say you do n't have control over land use , but you do have control over what you eat and that determines land use . "" We can choose the way we move in cities and if we do n't have access to public transport - make sure you are electing politicians who provide options around public transport . "" Five steps to 1.5 Global emissions of CO2 need to decline by 45 % from 2010 levels by 2030 Renewables are estimated to provide up to 85 % of global electricity by 2050 Coal is expected to reduce to close to zero Up to seven million sq km of land will be needed for energy crops ( a bit less than the size of Australia ) Global net zero emissions by 2050 How much will all this cost ? It wo n't come cheap . The report says to limit warming to 1.5C , will involve "" annual average investment needs in the energy system of around $ 2.4 trillion "" between 2016 and 2035 . Experts believe this number needs to be put in context . "" There are costs and benefits you have to weigh up , "" said Dr Stephen Cornelius , a former UK IPCC negotiator now with WWF . He says making big emissions cuts in the short term will cost money but be cheaper than paying for carbon dioxide removal later this century . "" The report also talks about the benefits as there is higher economic growth at 1.5 degrees than there is at 2C and you do n't have the higher risk of catastrophic impacts at 1.5 that you do at two .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/wall-street-journal-bjorn-lomborg-alarming-thing-climate-alarmism/,"It is an indisputable fact that carbon emissions are rising — and faster than most scientists predicted . But many climate - change alarmists seem to claim that all climate change is worse than expected . This ignores that much of the data are actually encouraging . The latest study from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that in the previous 15 years temperatures had risen 0.09 degrees Fahrenheit . The average of all models expected 0.8 degrees . So we ’re seeing about 90 % less temperature rise than expected . Facts like this are important because a one - sided focus on worst - case stories is a poor foundation for sound policies . Yes , Arctic sea ice is melting faster than the models expected . But models also predicted that Antarctic sea ice would decrease , yet it is increasing . Yes , sea levels are rising , but the rise is not accelerating — if anything , two recent papers , one by Chinese scientists published in the January 2014 issue of Global and Planetary Change , and the other by U.S. scientists published in the May 2013 issue of Coastal Engineering , have shown a small decline in the rate of sea - level increase . We are often being told that we ’re seeing more and more droughts , but a study published last March in the journal Nature actually shows a decrease in the world ’s surface that has been afflicted by droughts since 1982 . Hurricanes are likewise used as an example of the “ ever worse ” trope . If we look at the U.S. , where we have the best statistics , damage costs from hurricanes are increasing — but only because there are more people , with more - expensive property , living near coastlines . If we adjust for population and wealth , hurricane damage during the period 1900 - 2013 decreased slightly . At the U.N. climate conference in Lima , Peru , in December , attendees were told that their countries should cut carbon emissions to avoid future damage from storms like typhoon Hagupit , which hit the Philippines during the conference , killing at least 21 people and forcing more than a million into shelters . Yet the trend for landfalling typhoons around the Philippines has actually declined since 1950 , according to a study published in 2012 by the American Meteorological Society ’s Journal of Climate . Again , we ’re told that things are worse than ever , but the facts do n’t support this .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/daily-wire-article-misunderstands-study-carbon-budget-along-fox-news-telegraph-daily-mail-breitbart-james-barrett/,"A new report published by a team of prominent climate scientists confirms what many skeptics have pointed out for years : the climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming "" hiatus , "" over 20 years of almost no change in temperatures . The report , published in the journal Nature Geoscience on September 18 , acknowledges that most of the models of warming trends failed to predict the "" slowdown "" in warming post-2000 , resulting in less pronounced warming than predicted and thus more room in the CO2 "" emissions budget "" for the coming decades . The report in part intends to "" reset "" the estimations for the new predictions on when the earth will hit what the U.N. has determined to be dangerous warming levels . The team of climate scientists notes that in failing to predict the warming "" hiatus "" in the beginning of the 21st century , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) models overestimated temperature increases , consequently setting key benchmarks for warming earlier than they need to be , given the actual numbers . "" The models end up with a warming which is larger than the observed warming for the current emissions , "" University of Exerter 's Pierre Friedlingstein , one of the study 's authors , told The Washington Post . "" So , therefore , they derive a budget which is much lower , "" he added . Another co - author , the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis ' Joeir Rogelj , explained to the Post that the models used by the IPCC have made two mistakes : "" slightly overestimat[ing ] historical warming "" and "" underestimat[ing ] compatible historical CO2 emissions "" "" These two small discrepancies accumulate over time and lead to an slight underestimation of the remaining carbon budget , "" said Rogelj . The new study , he said , attempts to "" reset the uncertainties , starting from where we are today . "" The report follows a study by another team of climate scientists published in June 2017 that likewise determined that the actual increases in warming post-2000 was "" generally smaller than trends estimated "" from the models . Here 's the abstract of the study : In the early twenty - first century , satellite - derived tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large multi - model ensemble . Because observations and coupled model simulations do not have the same phasing of natural internal variability , such decadal differences in simulated and observed warming rates invariably occur . Here we analyse global - mean tropospheric temperatures from satellites and climate model simulations to examine whether warming rate differences over the satellite era can be explained by internal climate variability alone . We find that in the last two decades of the twentieth century , differences between modelled and observed tropospheric temperature trends are broadly consistent with internal variability . Over most of the early twenty - first century , however , model tropospheric warming is substantially larger than observed ; warming rate differences are generally outside the range of trends arising from internal variability . The probability that multi - decadal internal variability fully explains the asymmetry between the late twentieth and early twenty - first century results is low ( between zero and about 9 % ) . It is also unlikely that this asymmetry is due to the combined effects of internal variability and a model error in climate sensitivity . We conclude that model overestimation of tropospheric warming in the early twenty - first century is partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations . The Daily Caller notes a few other reports by climate scientists in the last few years that have likewise underscored the climate models ' overestimation of warming , with one determining that the models have predicted 2.5 times more warming than has actually been observed : Cato Institute scientists Patrick Michaels and Chip Knappenberger have noted the climate models have been over - hyping warming for decades . Scientist John Christy of the University of Alabama - Huntsville has testified before Congress on the matter . Christy ’s research has shown climate models show 2.5 times more warming in the bulk atmosphere than has been observed . ... [ The ] author and atmospheric scientist Ryan Maue wrote about the new “ consensus ” on global warming in the wake of a June study by prominent climate scientists . That study found “ satellite - derived tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large multi - model ensemble .","['Misleading', 'Inaccurate', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-post-article-accurately-discusses-warm-arctic-weather-event-jason-samenow/,"The sun wo n’t rise at the North Pole until March 20 , and it ’s normally close to the coldest time of year , but an extraordinary and possibly historic thaw swelled over the tip of the planet this weekend . Analyses show that the temperature warmed to the melting point as an enormous storm pumped an intense pulse of heat through the Greenland Sea . Temperatures may have soared as high as 35 degrees Fahrenheit ( 2 degrees Celsius ) at the pole , according to the U.S. Global Forecast System model . While there are no direct measurements of temperature there , Zack Labe , a climate scientist working on his PhD at the University of California at Irvine , confirmed that several independent analyses showed “ it was very close to freezing , ” which is more than 50 degrees ( 30 degrees Celsius ) above normal . The warm intrusion penetrated right through the heart of the Central Arctic , Labe said . The temperature averaged for the entire region north of 80 degrees latitude spiked to its highest level ever recorded in February . The average temperature was more than 36 degrees ( 20 degrees Celsius ) above normal . “ No other warm intrusions were very close to this , ” Labe said in an interview , describing a data set maintained by the Danish Meteorological Institute that dates back to 1958 . “ I was taken by surprise how expansive this warm intrusion was . ” Such extreme warm intrusions in the Arctic , once rare , are becoming more routine , research has shown . A study published last July found that since 1980 , these events are becoming more frequent , longer - lasting and more intense . “ Previously this was not common , ” said lead author of the study Robert Graham , from the Norwegian Polar Institute , in an email . “ It happened in four years between 1980 - 2010 , but has now occurred in four out of the last five winters . ” Arctic temperatures soar 45 degrees above normal , flooded by extremely mild air on all sides Graham explained that these warming events are related to the decline of winter sea ice in the Arctic , noting that January ’s ice extent was the lowest on record . “ As the sea ice is melting and thinning , it is becoming more vulnerable to these winter storms , ” he explained . “ The thinner ice drifts more quickly and can break up into smaller pieces . The strong winds from the south can push the ice further north into the Central Arctic , exposing the open water and releasing heat to the atmosphere from the ocean . ” Scientists were shocked in recent days to discover open water north of Greenland , an area normally covered by old , very thick ice . “ This has me more worried than the warm temps in the Arctic right now , ” tweeted Mike MacFerrin , an ice sheet specialist at the University of Colorado . Such warm water is appearing to have an effect on air temperatures . At the north tip of Greenland , about 400 miles to the south of the North Pole , the weather station Cape Morris Jesup has logged a record - crushing 61 hours above freezing so far this calendar year . The previous record , dating to 1980 , was 16 hours through the end of April in 2011 , according to Robert Rohde , a physicist at Berkeley Earth , a nonprofit that conducts temperature analysis . At one point , the temperature was as high as 43 degrees ( 6.1 degrees Celsius ) . Kent Moore , a professor of atmospheric physics at the University of Toronto , who published a study in 2016 linking the loss of sea ice to these warm events in the Arctic , said a number of factors may have contributed to the latest warming episode . For one , he said , recent storms have tracked more toward the North Pole through the Greenland Sea , drawing heat directly north from lower latitudes , rather than through a more circuitous route over the Barents Sea . He also said ocean temperatures in the Greenland Sea are warmer than normal . “ The warmth we ’re seeing in the Greenland Sea is definitely enhancing the warm events we ’re seeing , ” Moore said . “ I ’m surprised how warm it is , but I am not sure why . ” The rise in Arctic temperatures is probably also tied to a sudden warming of the stratosphere , the atmospheric layer about 30,000 feet high — above where most weather happens — that occurred several weeks ago , Moore said . Why these stratospheric warming events happen is poorly understood , as are their consequences . However , they tend to rearrange warm and cold air masses , and this latest one has also been linked not only to the Arctic warmth but also to the “ Beast from the East ” cold spell over Europe . Moore stopped short of saying that the warm spikes observed in the Arctic in recent years are a sure sign that they are becoming a fixture of the winter Arctic climate ; more data is needed , he cautioned . Whether a blip or indicative of a new normal , scientists have uniformly expressed disbelief at the current Arctic temperatures and the state of the sea ice . “ This is a crazy winter , ” said Alek Petty , a climate scientist at NASA , in an interview . “ I do n’t think we ’re sensationalizing it . ” “ It ’s never been this extreme , ” Ruth Mottram , a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute , told Reuters .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/independent-makes-giant-leap-global-warming-worse-than-thought-single-study-andrew-griffin/,"Global warming might be far worse than we thought , according to a new study . The research challenges the ways that researchers have worked out sea temperatures until now , meaning that they may be increasing quicker than previously suggested . The methodology widely used to understand sea temperatures in the scientific community may be based on a mistake , the new study suggests , and so our understanding of climate change might be fundamentally flawed . The new research suggests that the oceans hundreds of millions of years ago were much cooler than we thought . If true , that means that the global warming we are currently undergoing is unparallelled within the last 100 million years , and far worse than we had previously calculated . Until now , scientists believed that the temperature of the ocean depths and the surface of the polar ocean 100 million years ago were about 15 degrees warmer than they are today . But they might in fact have stayed relatively stable – making the warming we 're currently undergoing far more alarming . "" If we are right , our study challenges decades of paleoclimate research , "" said Anders Meibom , the head of EPFL 's Laboratory for Biological Geochemistry and a professor at the University of Lausanne . "" Oceans cover 70 % of our planet . They play a key role in the earth 's climate . Knowing the extent to which their temperatures have varied over geological time is crucial if we are to gain a fuller understanding of how they behave and to predict the consequences of current climate change more accurately . "" The researchers believe that scientists have been overlooking crucial processes when they calculated the temperature of the seas millions of years ago . In so doing , they may have been mistakenly thinking that they were warmer than they actually are . Until now , scientists have calculated the temperature of the ancient seas by looking at foraminifera , the fossils of tiny marine organisms found in the sediment on the ocean floor . Those form small shells and take on more or less of an oxygen isotope depending on how warm the water is , so by looking at the oxygen content they can estimate the temperature when those fossils were around . That working led scientists to believe that the temperature of the seas had fallen by 15 degrees over the last 100 million years . But the new research shows that the amount of oxygen in those shells does n't actually remain constant over time . The new research showed that they can change – and without leaving any visible trace that would alert scientists to that change . "" What appeared to be perfectly preserved fossils are in fact not . This means that the paleotemperature estimates made up to now are incorrect , "" said Sylvain Bernard , a CNRS researcher at the Paris - based Institute of Mineralogy , Materials Physics and Cosmochemistry and the study 's lead author . The scientists behind the study claim that the apparent cooling of the oceans was actually just the effect of the process they 've seen . The changes in the amount of oxygen in the shells is n't a reflection of changing temperatures – just a consequence of the fact that the amount of oxygen seen changes over time anyway . The French and Swiss researchers behind the paper have already got to work trying to understand what the temperatures actually are . "" To revisit the ocean 's paleotemperatures now , we need to carefully quantify this re - equilibration , which has been overlooked for too long . For that , we have to work on other types of marine organisms so that we clearly understand what took place in the sediment over geological time , "" said Professor Meibom . The research was conducted by French researchers from the French National Center for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) , Sorbonne University and the University of Strasbourg , and Swiss researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne ( EPFL ) and the University of Lausanne .

This is a hot , strange and dangerous summer across the planet . Greece is in mourning after scorching heat and high winds fueled wildfires that have killed more than 80 people . Japan recorded its highest temperature in history , 106 degrees , in a heat wave that killed 65 people in a week and hospitalized 22,000 , shortly after catastrophic flooding killed 200 . Ouargla , Algeria , hit 124 degrees on July 5 , a likely record for the continent of Africa . And the 109 - degree reading in Quriyat , Oman , on June 28 amazed meteorologists because that was n’t the day ’s high temperature . That was the low . It was the hottest low temperature ever recorded on Earth . Montreal hit 98 degrees on July 2 , its warmest temperature ever measured . Canadian health officials estimate as many as 70 people died in that heat wave . In the United States , 35 weather stations in the past month have set new marks for warm overnight temperatures . Southern California has had record heat and widespread power outages . In Yosemite Valley , which is imperiled by wildfires , park rangers have told everyone to flee . The brutal weather has been supercharged by human - induced climate change , scientists say . Climate models for three decades have predicted exactly what the world is seeing this summer . And they predict that it will get hotter — and that what is a record today could someday be the norm . “ The old records belong to a world that no longer exists , ” said Martin Hoerling , a research meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . It ’s not just heat . A warming world is prone to multiple types of extreme weather — heavier downpours , stronger hurricanes , longer droughts . “ You see roads melting , airplanes not being able to take off , there ’s not enough water , ” said Katharine Hayhoe , director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University . “ Climate change hits us at our Achilles ’ heel . In the Southwest , it ’s water availability . On the Gulf Coast , it ’s hurricanes . In the East , it ’s flooding . It ’s exacerbating the risks we already face today . ” The proximate cause of the Northern Hemisphere bake - off is the unusual behavior of the jet stream , a wavy track of west - to - east - prevailing wind at high altitude . The jet stream controls broad weather patterns , such as high - pressure and low - pressure systems . The extent of climate change ’s influence on the jet stream is an intense subject of research . This summer , the jet stream has undulated in extreme waves that have tended to block weather systems from migrating . The result has been stagnant high - pressure and low - pressure systems with dire results , such as heat waves in some places and flooding elsewhere . “ When those waves are very big — as they have been for the past few weeks — they tend to get stuck in place , ” said Jennifer Francis , a professor of atmospheric science at Rutgers University . Last year , scientists published evidence that the conditions leading up to “ stuck jet streams ” are becoming more common , with warming in the Arctic seen as a likely culprit . Gone are the days when scientists drew a bright line dividing weather and climate . Now researchers can examine a weather event and estimate how much climate change had to do with causing or exacerbating it . Last year , when Hurricane Harvey broke the record for how much rain could fall from a single storm , researchers knew climate change had been a factor . Months later , scientists presented findings that Harvey dumped at least 15 percent more rain in Houston than it would have without global warming . Theory , meet reality : When the atmosphere is warmer , it can hold more moisture . Climate change does not cause hurricanes to spin up or thunderstorms to develop , but it can be an intensifier . In Dallas , where the temperature hit 100 on 10 out of 11 days this month , three homeless people have died of heat - related causes in the past week , said Brenda Snitzer , executive director of the Stewpot , a downtown shelter . In Phoenix , where this week ’s temperature hit 116 degrees , Dustin Nye , 36 , who spent the day installing air - conditioning units , said he has suffered heat stroke in the past and still gets woozy . “ It takes a special breed to do this all day long in this heat , ” he said . “ You ’ve really got to work up your endurance and just buckle down and deal with it . ” In Los Angeles , Marty Adams , chief operating officer of the Department of Water and Power , said , “ It seems like every year , we ’ve had some type of temperature anomaly that we normally would not have . ” Residents of beach cities such as Long Beach and Santa Monica , who normally rely on the ocean breeze to cool their homes , have added air - conditioning units , which strains the grid and has contributed to power outages , he said . Said Hayhoe : “ The biggest myth that the largest number of people have bought into is that ‘ climate change does n’t matter to me personally . ’ ” The heat waves have hit hard where people do n’t expect them — the Netherlands , Sweden , Britain , Ireland and Canada . “ Our office does n’t have air conditioning . I do have a fan , ” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh , a climate researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/forbes-james-taylor-top-10-global-warming-lies-that-may-shock-you/,"Global warming alarmists frequently make false and deplorable assertions ( see , for example , my recent column debunking false claims that global warming is causing a decline in wheat production ) , but the Environmental Defense Fund ’s recent fund - raising mailer , “ 10 Global Warming Effects That May Shock You , ” may well set a new low . However , climate realists can make lemonade from EDF ’s preposterous mailer by using it to show open - minded people the difference between global warming alarmists and global warming truth - tellers . EDF has assembled what it believes to be the 10 most powerful global warming assertions in the alarmists ’ playbook , yet each assertion either backfires on alarmists or has been proven false . While reading how flawed EDF ’s assertions are , remember these are the very best arguments global warming alarmists can make . Open - minded readers should have very little difficulty dismissing the mythical global warming crisis after examining the top 10 assertions in the alarmist playbook . Alarmist Assertion # 1 “ Bats Drop from the Sky – In 2014 , a scorching summer heat wave caused more than 100,000 bats to literally drop dead and fall from the sky in Queensland , Australia . ” The Facts Global warming alarmists ’ preferred electricity source – wind power – kills nearly 1 million bats every year ( to say nothing of the more than 500,000 birds killed every year ) in the United States alone . This appalling death toll occurs every year even while wind power produces just 3 % of U.S. electricity . Ramping up wind power to 10 , 20 , or 30 % of U.S. electricity production would likely increase annual bat kills to 10 - to-30 million every year . Killing 30 million bats every year in response to dubious claims that global warming might once in a great while kill 100,000 bats makes no sense . Just as importantly , alarmists present no evidence that global warming caused the summer heat wave in a notoriously hot desert near the equator . To the contrary , climate change theory and objective data show our recent global warming is occurring primarily in the winter , toward the poles , and at night . Australia ’s highest recorded temperature occurred more than half a century ago , and only two of Australia ’s seven states have set their all - time temperature record during the past 40 years . Indeed , Queensland ’s 2014 heat wave paled in comparison to the 1972 heat wave that occurred 42 years of global warming ago . If global warming caused the 2014 Queensland heat wave , why was n’t it as severe as the 1972 Queensland heat wave ? Blaming every single summer heat wave or extreme weather event on global warming is a stale and discredited tactic in the alarmist playbook . Objective science proves extreme weather events such as hurricanes , tornadoes , heat waves , and droughts have become less frequent and less severe as a result of the Earth ’s recent modest warming . Alarmist Assertion # 2 “ Lyme Disease Spreads ” – Warmer temperatures are contributing to the range expansion and severity of tick - borne Lyme disease . ” The Facts Lyme Disease is much more common in northern , cooler regions of the United States than in southern , warmer regions . Asserting , without any supporting data or evidence , that a disease that prospers in cool climates will become more prevalent as a result of global warming defies objective data and common sense . Moreover , a team of scientists extensively researched Lyme Disease climate and habitat and reported in the peer - reviewed science journal EcoHealth , “ the only environmental variable consistently association with increased [ Lyme Disease ] risk and incidence was the presence of forests . ” Granted , alarmists can argue that forests are thriving under global warming , with the result that forest - dwelling ticks will also benefit . However , expanding forests are universally – and properly – viewed as environmentally beneficial . Alarmist attempts to frame thriving forests as harmful perfectly illustrate the alarmists ’ proclivity to claim anything and everything – no matter how beneficial – is severely harmful and caused by global warming . Moreover , even if global warming expanded Lyme Disease range , one must look at the totality of global warming ’s impact on the range of viruses and diseases . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reports Lyme Disease “ is rare as a cause of death in the United States . ” According to the CDC , Lyme Disease is a contributing factor to less than 25 deaths per year in the United States . Indeed , during a recent five - year span examined by the CDC , “ only 1 [ death ] record was consistent with clinical manifestations of Lyme Disease . ” Any attempts to claim global warming will cause a few more Lyme Disease deaths must be weighed against the 36,000 Americans who are killed by the flu each year . The U.S. National Institutes of Health have documented how influenza is aided and abetted by cold climate . Any attempt to connect a warmer climate to an increase in Lyme Disease must be accompanied by an acknowledgement of a warmer climate ’s propensity to reduce influenza incidence and mortality . The net impact of a warmer climate on viruses and diseases such as Lyme Disease and influenza is substantially beneficial and life - saving . Alarmist Assertion # 3 “ National Security Threatened – The impacts of climate change are expected to act as a ‘ threat multiplier ’ in many of the world ’s most unstable regions , exacerbating droughts and other natural disasters as well as leading to food , water and other resource shortages that may spur mass migrations .","['Inaccurate', 'Misleading', 'Cherry-picking', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Biased']"

In other words , the so - called “ Consensus ” on global warming is a massive lie . And Donald Trump was quite right to quit the Paris agreement which pretended that the massive lie was true . By “ global warming ” these papers do n’t , of course , mean the mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius that the planet has experienced since the middle of the 19th century as the world crawled out of the Little Ice Age . Pretty much everyone , alarmists and skeptics alike , is agreed on that . Rather , they mean “ global warming ” in the sense that is most commonly used today by grant - troughing scientists , and huxter politicians , and scaremongering green activists , and brainwashed mainstream media ( MSM ) environmental correspondents . “ Global warming ” as in the scary , historically unprecedented , primarily man - made phenomenon which we must address urgently before the icecaps melt and the Pacific islands disappear beneath the waves and all the baby polar bears drown . What all these papers argue in their different ways is that the alarmist version of global warming — aka Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming ( CAGW ) — is a fake artefact . That is , all these different experts from around the world — China , Russia , Canada , the U.S. , Italy , etc . — have been looking closely at different aspects of the global warming puzzle in various regions and on different timescales and come to the conclusion in irreproachable , peer - reviewed scientific ways that there is no evidence to support the global warming scare story . Late 20th century and early 21st century global warming , they show , is neither dramatic , nor unusual , nor scary . Here , as collated by Kenneth Richard at No Tricks Zone , are just some of the charts to prove it . Büntgen et al , below , shows that temperatures in the northern hemisphere were warmer in the early 1400s than they are today Abrantes et al ( below ) confirms the traditional view — which Michael Mann tried to dismiss with his discredited Hockey Stick chart — that the Medieval Warming Period was warmer than anything we have experienced in our own era . Here ’s one from Li et al showing that China was much warmer 8,000 years ago Here ’s an unusual one from Guillet et al suggesting that there ’s nothing new about wildly early or late grape harvests through the centuries : And on and on it goes — there are 80 graphs in all , each showing in its different way why the scare about global warming has been horribly overdone because the evidence just does n’t support its being unusual or a problem . Several of the papers note that the primary influence on warming appears to be solar activity . Few , if any , entertain the notion that carbon dioxide levels have much to do with it . The intellectually corrupt and mendacious alarmist science establishment — I ’m thinking , for example , of my personal bete noir , the left - wing political activist and Nobel - prizewinning geneticist Sir Paul Nurse , former president of the Royal Society — would have us believe that climate skepticism is a minority activity , the preserve of a few cranks , championed only by people who do n’t do the science . But this is just ugly propaganda . Here are dozens of reputable scientists from around the world with no axe to grind collaborating on studies which all corroborate , independently and rigorously , the increasingly respectable view that “ man - made global warming ” just is n’t a thing . Not that it ever was a thing , really . This debate — as I argue at some length in Watermelons — was always about left - wing ideology , quasi - religious hysteria , and “ follow the money ” corruption , never about “ science . ” Still , it ’s always a comfort to know that “ the science ” is on our side too .

In the contiguous United States , the year was the second - warmest on record , punctuated by a December that was both the hottest and the wettest since record - keeping began . One result has been a wave of unusual winter floods coursing down the Mississippi River watershed . Scientists started predicting a global temperature record months ago , in part because an El Niño weather pattern , one of the largest in a century , is releasing an immense amount of heat from the Pacific Ocean into the atmosphere . But the bulk of the record - setting heat , they say , is a consequence of the long - term planetary warming caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases . “ The whole system is warming up , relentlessly , ” said Gerald A. Meehl , a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo. It will take a few more years to know for certain , but the back - to - back records of 2014 and 2015 may have put the world back onto a trajectory of rapid global warming , after a period of relatively slow warming dating to the last powerful El Niño , in 1998 . Politicians attempting to claim that greenhouse gases are not a problem seized on that slow period to argue that “ global warming stopped in 1998 , ” with these claims and similar statements reappearing recently on the Republican presidential campaign trail . Statistical analysis suggested all along that the claims were false , and that the slowdown was , at most , a minor blip in an inexorable trend , perhaps caused by a temporary increase in the absorption of heat by the Pacific Ocean . “ Is there any evidence for a pause in the long - term global warming rate ? ” said Gavin A. Schmidt , head of NASA ’s climate - science unit , the Goddard Institute for Space Studies , in Manhattan . “ The answer is no . That was true before last year , but it ’s much more obvious now . ” Michael E. Mann , a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University , calculated that if the global climate were not warming , the odds of setting two back - to - back record years would be remote , about one chance in every 1,500 pairs of years . Given the reality that the planet is warming , the odds become far higher , about one chance in 10 , according to Dr. Mann ’s calculations . Two American government agencies — NASA , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , and NOAA , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — compile separate analyses of the global temperature , based upon thousands of measurements from weather stations , ships and ocean buoys scattered around the world . Meteorological agencies in Britain and Japan do so , as well . The agencies follow slightly different methods to cope with problems in the data , but obtain similar results . The American agencies released figures on Wednesday showing that 2015 was the warmest year in a global record that began , in their data , in 1880 . British scientists released figures showing 2015 as the warmest in a record dating to 1850 . The Japan Meteorological Agency had already released preliminary results showing 2015 as the warmest year in a record beginning in 1891 . On Jan. 7 , NOAA reported that 2015 was the second - warmest year on record , after 2012 , for the lower 48 United States . That land mass covers less than 2 percent of the surface of the Earth , so it is not unusual to have a slight divergence between United States temperatures and those of the planet as a whole . The end of the year was especially remarkable in the United States , with virtually every state east of the Mississippi River having a record warm December , often accompanied by heavy rains . A warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor , and an intensification of rainstorms was one of the fundamental predictions made by climate scientists decades ago as a consequence of human emissions . That prediction has come to pass , with the rains growing more intense across every region of the United States , but especially so in the East . The term global warming is generally taken to refer to the temperature trend at the surface of the planet , and those are the figures reported by the agencies on Wednesday . Some additional measurements , of shorter duration , are available for the ocean depths and the atmosphere above the surface , both generally showing an inexorable long - term warming trend . Most satellite measurements of the lower and middle layers of the atmosphere show 2015 to have been the third- or fourth - warmest year in a 37 - year record , and scientists said it was slightly surprising that the huge El Niño had not produced a greater warming there . They added that this could yet happen in 2016 . When temperatures are averaged at a global scale , the differences between years are usually measured in fractions of a degree . In the NOAA data set , 2015 was 0.29 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than 2014 , the largest jump ever over a previous record . NASA calculated a slightly smaller figure , but still described it as an unusual one - year increase . The intense warmth of 2015 contributed to a heat wave in India last spring that turns out to have been the second - worst in that country ’s history , killing an estimated 2,500 people .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/popular-article-in-the-independent-accurately-summarizes-june-heat-in-europe-conrad-duncan/,"Last month was the hottest June ever recorded , the EU‘s satellite agency has announced . Data provided by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ( C3S ) , implemented by the European Centre for Medium - Range Weather Forecasts on behalf of the EU , showed that the global average temperature for June 2019 was the highest on record for the month . The data showed European average ​temperatures were more than 2C above normal and temperatures were 6 - 10C above normal over most of France , Germany and northern Spain during the final days of the month , according to C3S. The global average temperature was about 0.1C higher than during the previous warmest June in 2016 . Experts have said climate change made last week ’s record - breaking European heatwave at least five times as likely to happen , according to recent analysis . Rapid assessment of average temperatures in France between 26 - 28 June showed a “ substantial ” increase in the likelihood of the heatwave happening as a result of human - caused global warming , experts at the World Weather Attribution group said . The recent heatwave saw France record the hottest temperature in the country ’s history ( 45.9C ) and major wildfires across Spain , where temperatures exceeded 40C. Germany , Poland and Czech Republic also recorded their highest temperatures for June last week . C3S admitted it is difficult to directly link the heatwave to climate change but noted that such extreme weather events are expected to become more common due to global warming . Jean - Noel Thepaut , head of C3S , said : ” Although local temperatures may have been lower or higher than those forecast , our data shows that the temperatures over the southwestern region of Europe during the last week of June were unusually high . “ Although this was exceptional , we are likely to see more of these events in the future due to climate change . ” Peter Stott , an expert in analysing the role of climate change in extreme weather​ at the Met Office , claimed that “ a similarly extreme heatwave 100 years ago would have likely been around 4C cooler ” . Spikes in European average temperatures of more than 1C above normal have occurred before , such as in 1917 and 1999 , but C3S said the recent heatwave was notable because the sudden increase came on top of a general rise of around 1.5C in European temperature over the past 100 years . In response to the record - breaking heat , Professor Hannah Cloke , natural hazards researcher at the University of Reading , said : “ We knew June was hot in Europe , but this study shows that temperature records have n’t just been broken . They have been obliterated . “ This is the hottest June on record in Europe by a country mile , and the warmest June we have ever seen globally . “ Heatwaves occur in any climate , but we know that heatwaves are becoming much more likely due to climate change . The global climate just keeps getting hotter , as greenhouse gases continue to build up , as scientists have predicted for decades . ” However , she added : “ Rapid attempts to find links between climate change and single extreme weather events are possible , but often come with many caveats . We should be careful not to ignore these caveats when we look at the conclusions of quick - turnaround attribution studies .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/andrew-freedman-south-carolina-flooding-climate-change/,"The epic amount of rain that led to deadly , catastrophic flooding across large parts of South Carolina and North Carolina is an example of exactly the type of supercharged storm system climate scientists have been warning about for years as a likely consequence of global warming . This storm , like others that have come before it -- from a massive deluge that flooded Oklahoma City to a flooding event in Houston , both of which occurred earlier this year -- are examples of how the atmosphere is behaving in new ways now that there 's more water vapor and heat for weather systems to work with . [ seealso url=""http://mashable.com/2015/10/04 / columbia - flood - instagram/#7rmowljW2gqC "" ] It 's not that heavy downpours and floods did n't occur before manmade global warming became evident ( for the record , they did ) . The issue now is that these events are even more severe than they otherwise would have been . And they are becoming more frequent in many areas . Though there are significant limits on what climate scientists can say at this point about an event like the South Carolina floods , it 's well - established that global warming has already led to a measurable increase in global atmospheric water vapor levels , and this moisture can be wrung out as heavier bursts of rain or snow . It is also well - established in scientific literature that precipitation is increasingly falling in short , intense bursts rather than long - lasting , generally lighter events . The risk for extreme precipitation events is increasing in many parts of the world . One study , for example , showed that a 1 - in-100 year winter - rainfall event in parts of the United Kingdom is already occurring more frequently , becoming a 1 - in-80 year event . This means that an event with a 1 % chance of occurring each year now has a 1.25 % risk of occurring in any particular winter , which translates to a 25 % increase in risk , according to Oxford University scientists . Water vapor and the Carolina firehose While it 's too soon to say precisely how global warming may have affected the rare confluence of events that conspired to dump at least 26.88 inches of rain in less than four days on South Carolina , changes in extreme precipitation events are one of global warming 's most well - documented climate change impacts . First , consider how significant this rainfall event has been . Charleston and Columbia saw so much rain in four days that they both blew past their previous records for the all - time wettest October , along with setting numerous other milestones . Across South Carolina , nearly 400 roads and 158 bridges were closed on Monday due to the flooding that killed nine . More than two dozen evacuation shelters are open , and 30,000 residents are still without power . [ video id = c1NzExeDrZh0dAia4f71ppd3qcKOtonn ] The record - shattering rains in Charleston and Columbia , as well as other parts of North and South Carolina , were rarer than a 1 - in-1,000 year event , based on recurrence intervals from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) . This means that they 'd have just a 0.1 % chance or less of occurring in a given year . As many climate scientists will say , though , we seem to be seeing more and more 500 - year to 1,000 - year events lately , to the point where the definition of such events and their return intervals may need to change . How did this happen ? There were four main meteorological players in this extreme weather event , each of which raised the odds for a record rainfall event in the Carolinas and caused weather forecasters to sound the alarm for the Palmetto State as early as midweek last week . These atmospheric players include an upper - level low - pressure area across the Southeast ; a stationary front with an area of low pressure riding along it ; Hurricane Joaquin , which passed off the East Coast and moved close to Bermuda ; as well as a strong area of high pressure parked across southern Quebec . These weather systems led to multiple moisture feeds directed at the Carolinas in firehose - like fashion for an unusually long time . Rainfall rates of 1 - to-4 inches per hour or higher were recorded in the Charleston area and other locations for multiple hours at a time . The creeping progress of the weather pattern , with the blocking high across Quebec playing a role in this , helped keep this firehose in place for days -- from Thursday through Monday . Some studies have shown that stuck weather patterns have become more common in recent years , potentially tied to rapid Arctic warming , though this link is not accepted by all of the mainstream climate science community . Think of some of these weather systems as pipelines directly connected to major moisture sources : the unusually mild waters of the tropical Pacific Ocean ; milder - than - average waters of the western Atlantic ; and a water - laden Hurricane Joaquin . Climate change increases risk of extreme rainfall events Across the U.S. as a whole , the frequency of 2 - inch or greater rainstorms has increased in recent decades , and extreme precipitation events have been on the rise across the Northern Hemisphere as well . A Climate Central analysis released in May found that 40 of the lower 48 states have seen an overall increase in heavy downpours ( the days where total precipitation exceeded the top 1 % of all rain and snow days ) since 1950 . However , South Carolina was one of the few states that did not see an increase , based on that analysis . In fact , it saw a slight decrease in the frequency of heavy precipitation events . Neighboring states , including Georgia and North Carolina , did see increases , though .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-post-accurately-covers-permafrost-study-albeit-under-a-somewhat-sensational-headline-chris-mooney/,"For some time , scientists fearing the mass release of greenhouse gases from the carbon - rich , frozen soils of the Arctic have had at least one morsel of good news in their forecasts : They predicted most of the gas released would be carbon dioxide , which , though a greenhouse gas , drives warming more slowly than some other gases . Scientists obviously were n’t excited about more carbon dioxide emissions , but it was better than the alternative : methane , a shorter - lived but far harder - hitting gas that could cause faster bursts of warming . Now even that silver lining is in doubt . Research released Monday suggests that methane releases could be considerably more prevalent as Arctic permafrost thaws . The research finds that in waterlogged wetland soils , where oxygen is not prevalent , tiny microorganisms will produce a considerable volume of methane , a gas that does n’t last in the air much more than a decade but has a warming effect many times that of carbon dioxide over a period of 100 years . “ What we can definitely say is that the importance of methane was underestimated until now in the carbon studies , ” said Christian Knobloch , a researcher at Universität Hamburg in Germany and the lead author of the study , published in Nature Climate Change . The Arctic is full of toxic mercury , and climate change is going to release it The divergent finding came after Knoblauch and his colleagues conducted a lengthy experiment , more than seven years long , monitoring patches of submerged and artificially warmed soil from Siberia in the laboratory , and gradually seeing sensitive methane - producing microorganisms become more prevalent over time . Knoblauch contends that other studies have not examined waterlogged Arctic soils for as long , and he notes that in some cases it took three years or more for the methane - generating microorganisms to really get cranking . “ What we saw is that it takes a very long time until methane starts being produced , and the study that we did is really the first one which is so long , ” Knoblauch said . The research was conducted along with colleagues from several institutions in Germany , Sweden and Russia . So much methane was produced in the experiment , the researchers calculated that the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from wet soils , or wetlands , will be higher than from drier soils , where carbon dioxide should indeed be the top gas released . This finding , if further confirmed , could reorient calculations of the overall potential of permafrost to worsen global warming over the coming century . ‘ We all knew this was coming ’ : Alaska ’s thawing soils are now pouring carbon dioxide into the air For instance , one major study of the permafrost warming potential , published in 2015 in the journal Nature , played down the potential for methane release in wet soils , saying drier soils would be the bigger problem . “ In spite of the more potent greenhouse gas CH4 , a unit of newly thawed permafrost carbon could have a greater impact on climate over a century if it thaws and decomposes within a drier , aerobic soil as compared to an equivalent amount of carbon within a waterlogged soil or sediment , ” that research found . The new study would appear to contradict this . But Knoblauch cautions that more research would have to be done to go from these results to a forecast for just how much methane could waft from permafrost in the coming decades . It will be important to know , for instance , how much thawed permafrost will be stuck in watery conditions vs. dry ones . One Arctic permafrost expert not involved in the research , Merritt Turetsky of the University of Guelph , praised the new study , noting that the researchers had spent a long time trying to uncover the behavior of tiny methane - producing organisms in watery soil . The research , she said , could help bridge the gap between field studies of waterlogged permafrost that have detected methane emissions and laboratory studies that have seemed to play down the importance of the gas . “ What ’s remarkable about this study is the length of time they spent tracking the communities , and I think that offers a potential reason for why field and lab studies have disagreed with each other , ” Turetsky said . Warming of the Arctic is ‘ unprecedented over the last 1,500 years , ’ scientists say She said the total amount of permafrost carbon that could be vulnerable because of global warming during this century — perhaps 10 percent of it , which would be more than enough to undermine global climate goals — probably wo n’t change in light of the new research . But the fraction of that carbon that is emitted as methane , as opposed to carbon dioxide , will be crucial , she said , and remains to be determined . “ We absolutely have to partition that total permafrost carbon release into those two forms , because it really matters , ” Turetsky said . “ So I think that has got to be where the community goes next . ” But Róisín Commane , a research associate at Harvard who studies the Arctic atmosphere and also was not involved in this research , was more skeptical about relying on this study to assume a worse verdict about methane . The study was “ very nicely done , ” she said , but the tendency of wet soils to produce methane could be counteracted by several factors . The soils could also become host to organisms that devour that methane — and turn it into carbon dioxide .",['Sound_reasoning']

By 2070 , that could be about a third of the overall global population at that time . Marten Scheffer of Wageningen University in the Netherlands , an ecologist and co - author of the study , told the Associated Press the projections are "" unlivable for the ordinary , for poor people , for the average world citizen .

Mahowald was n't apart of the study but told the AP that "" the new study makes sense and conveys the urgency of the man - made climate change differently than past research . "" Scheffer told the AP that for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit increase in global average annual temperature "" from man - made climate change , "" about a billion people will end up in areas too warm to live .

The AP reported that the range was found after scientists looked at "" humans like they do bears , birds , and bees to find the ' climate niche ' where people and civilizations flourish . "" While humans can live in hotter and colder weather , the further away from that range the harder it is . The researchers looked at areas most likely to experience the change in range and estimated that around 2 billion people will be living there in the next 50 years .

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scientists-explain-what-new-york-magazine-article-on-the-uninhabitable-earth-gets-wrong-david-wallace-wells/,"I. ‘ Doomsday ’ Peering beyond scientific reticence . It is , I promise , worse than you think . If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea - level rise , you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible , even within the lifetime of a teenager today . And yet the swelling seas — and the cities they will drown — have so dominated the picture of global warming , and so overwhelmed our capacity for climate panic , that they have occluded our perception of other threats , many much closer at hand . Rising oceans are bad , in fact very bad ; but fleeing the coastline will not be enough . Indeed , absent a significant adjustment to how billions of humans conduct their lives , parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable , and other parts horrifically inhospitable , as soon as the end of this century . Even when we train our eyes on climate change , we are unable to comprehend its scope . This past winter , a string of days 60 and 70 degrees warmer than normal baked the North Pole , melting the permafrost that encased Norway ’s Svalbard seed vault — a global food bank nicknamed “ Doomsday , ” designed to ensure that our agriculture survives any catastrophe , and which appeared to have been flooded by climate change less than ten years after being built . The Doomsday vault is fine , for now : The structure has been secured and the seeds are safe . But treating the episode as a parable of impending flooding missed the more important news . Until recently , permafrost was not a major concern of climate scientists , because , as the name suggests , it was soil that stayed permanently frozen . But Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon , more than twice as much as is currently suspended in the Earth ’s atmosphere . When it thaws and is released , that carbon may evaporate as methane , which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse - gas warming blanket as carbon dioxide when judged on the timescale of a century ; when judged on the timescale of two decades , it is 86 times as powerful . In other words , we have , trapped in Arctic permafrost , twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet , all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up , partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over . Maybe you know that already — there are alarming stories in the news every day , like those , last month , that seemed to suggest satellite data showed the globe warming since 1998 more than twice as fast as scientists had thought ( in fact , the underlying story was considerably less alarming than the headlines ) . Or the news from Antarctica this past May , when a crack in an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days , then kept going ; the break now has just three miles to go — by the time you read this , it may already have met the open water , where it will drop into the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever , a process known poetically as “ calving . ” But no matter how well - informed you are , you are surely not alarmed enough . Over the past decades , our culture has gone apocalyptic with zombie movies and Mad Max dystopias , perhaps the collective result of displaced climate anxiety , and yet when it comes to contemplating real - world warming dangers , we suffer from an incredible failure of imagination . The reasons for that are many : the timid language of scientific probabilities , which the climatologist James Hansen once called “ scientific reticence ” in a paper chastising scientists for editing their own observations so conscientiously that they failed to communicate how dire the threat really was ; the fact that the country is dominated by a group of technocrats who believe any problem can be solved and an opposing culture that does n’t even see warming as a problem worth addressing ; the way that climate denialism has made scientists even more cautious in offering speculative warnings ; the simple speed of change and , also , its slowness , such that we are only seeing effects now of warming from decades past ; our uncertainty about uncertainty , which the climate writer Naomi Oreskes in particular has suggested stops us from preparing as though anything worse than a median outcome were even possible ; the way we assume climate change will hit hardest elsewhere , not everywhere ; the smallness ( two degrees ) and largeness ( 1.8 trillion tons ) and abstractness ( 400 parts per million ) of the numbers ; the discomfort of considering a problem that is very difficult , if not impossible , to solve ; the altogether incomprehensible scale of that problem , which amounts to the prospect of our own annihilation ; simple fear . But aversion arising from fear is a form of denial , too . In between scientific reticence and science fiction is science itself . This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields and reflects hundreds of scientific papers on the subject of climate change . What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much - less - certain science of human response . Instead , it is a portrait of our best understanding of where the planet is heading absent aggressive action . It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized , largely because the devastation along the way will shake our complacency .","['Alarmist', 'Misleading', 'Inaccurate']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/arctic-ice-melt-already-affecting-weather-patterns-live-right-now-damian-carrington-the-guardian/,"The dramatic melting of Arctic ice is already driving extreme weather that affects hundreds of millions of people across North America , Europe and Asia , leading climate scientists have told the Guardian . Severe “ snowmageddon ” winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures , say researchers , with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked . The scientists now fear the Arctic meltdown has kickstarted abrupt changes in the planet ’s swirling atmosphere , bringing extreme weather in heavily populated areas to the boil . The northern ice cap has been shrinking since the 1970s , with global warming driving the loss of about three - quarters of its volume so far . But the recent heat in the Arctic has shocked scientists , with temperatures 33C above average in parts of the Russian Arctic and 20C higher in some other places . In November , ice levels hit a record low , and we are now in “ uncharted territory ” , said Prof Jennifer Francis , an Arctic climate expert at Rutgers University in the US , who first became interested in the region when she sailed through it on a round - the - world trip in the 1980s . “ These rapid changes in the Arctic are affecting weather patterns where you live right now , ” she said . “ In the past you have had natural variations like El Niño , but they have never happened before in combination with this very warm Arctic , so it is a whole new ball game . “ It is inconceivable that this ridiculously warm Arctic would not have an impact on weather patterns in the middle latitudes further south , where so many people live . “ It ’s safe to say [ the hot Arctic ] is going to have a big impact , but it ’s hard to say exactly how big right now . But we are going to have a lot of very interesting weather – we ’re not going to get around that one . ” The chain of events that links the melting Arctic with weather to the south begins with rising global temperatures causing more sea ice to melt . Unlike on the Antarctic continent , melting ice here exposes dark ocean beneath , which absorbs more sunlight than ice and warms further . This feedback loop is why the Arctic is heating up much faster than the rest of the planet . This in turn narrows the temperature difference between the Arctic and lower latitudes , which is crucial because it is the temperature gradient between them that drives the jet stream wind , which streaks around the pole at up to 250 mph and about 8 km above the surface . The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south , but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker . This means the jet stream meanders more , with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes . Furthermore , researchers say , the changes mean the loops can remain stuck over regions for weeks , rather than being blown westwards as in the past . This “ blocking ” effect means extreme events can unfold . “ There have been recent studies showing very plausible physical mechanisms of how rapid warming in the Arctic can influence weather in the mid latitudes , both in summer and winter , ” said Dim Coumou at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany . Coumou is a former offshore industry geophysicist who has studied the link between extreme weather events and global warming since 2010 . “ A couple of years ago this was the main criticism on any such links , that the physics was not well understood , ” he said . “ But the big question [ now ] is , how important are these mechanisms ? ” The other main influence on the jet stream is sea surface temperature in the tropics , which waxes and wanes with El Niño , while solar cycles and even volcanic eruptions have smaller effects . The clearest connection so far between the melting Arctic and weather is for extreme winter conditions , such as the intense winters that hit parts of North America and northern Europe in 2009 - 10 , 2010 - 11 and 2013 - 14 , causing record snowfalls and billions of dollars of damage . In those years , the jet stream deviated deeply southwards over those regions , pulling down savagely cold air . Prof Adam Scaife , a climate modelling expert at the UK ’s Met Office , said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good : “ The consensus points towards that being a real effect . ” While downswings of the jet stream can bring freezing winters , the accompanying upswings have been linked to worsening the drought in California . “ These northward jet stream swings are of course the reason California is having such a terrible drought , ” said Francis . This effect was in fact predicted back in 2004 , with those researchers now saying : “ Reality is moving faster than we thought or hoped it would . ” But the winter extremes can also swing the other way and bring mild but torrential weather , as seen in the past two winters in the UK , leading to severe flooding , said Prof Edward Hanna , at the University of Sheffield in the UK . He pointed to the North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) , a cyclic variation in air pressure that may be affected by the fast melting of Arctic ice . The variability of the NOA has doubled in the last century , he said : “ Within the last decade , there have been wild swings in the NAO values in December .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/higher-global-temperatures-sea-ice-record-lows-poles-brandon-miller-cnn/,"CNN — For what appears to be the first time since scientists began keeping track , sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic are at record lows this time of year . “ It looks like , since the beginning of October , that for the first time we are seeing both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice running at record low levels , ” said Walt Meier , a research scientist with the Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center , who has tracked sea ice data going back to 1979 . While record low sea ice is nothing new in the Arctic , this is a surprising turn of events for the Antarctic . Even as sea ice in the Arctic has seen a rapid and consistent decline over the past decade , its counterpart in the Southern Hemisphere has seen its extent increasing . In fact , each year from 2012 through 2014 reached a record high for Antarctic sea ice extent . Skeptics have long pointed to ice gain in the Southern Hemisphere as evidence climate change was n’t occurring , but scientists warned that it was caused by natural variations and circulations in the atmosphere . While it is too early to know if the recent , rapid decline in Antarctic sea ice is going to be a regular occurrence like in the Arctic , it “ certainly puts the kibosh on everyone saying that Antarctica ’s ice is just going up and up , ” Meier said . The decline of sea ice has been a key indicator that climate change is happening , but its loss , especially in the Arctic , can mean major changes for your weather , too . What ’s going on in the Arctic ? Temperatures in the Arctic have soared recently , and scientists are struggling to explain exactly why , and what the consequences will be . Air temperatures have been running more than 35 degrees Fahrenheit ( 20 degrees Celsius ) above average . At the same time , sea ice in the northern latitudes is at a lower level than ever observed for this time of the year . October and November are typically a time of rapid ice gain for the Arctic region , as daylight hours become shorter and shorter and eventually non - existent during what ’s referred to as the “ polar night . ” Air temperatures plummet to below zero degrees Fahrenheit and parts of the Arctic Ocean not covered with ice quickly become covered . But this year , those air temperatures are staying much warmer , closer to the freezing mark of 32 degrees Fahrenheit . When you compare 2016 Arctic sea ice to 1984 , multiyear ice ( white color ) is on the decline . NASA To make matters worse , the water temperatures in the Arctic Ocean are several degrees above average , which is an expected result of having less sea ice . With less ice in the summer , more of the sun ’s rays can heat the darker water , as opposed to being deflected back into space by the white ice cover . The result is a feedback loop , and one that scientists have warned about for some time . “ The interaction between Arctic ocean temperatures and the loss of ice formation leading to continuing record minimums is clearly a climate change signal , ” said Thomas Mote , a geography research professor at the University of Georgia . As it becomes clearer that the entire climate system in the Arctic , and potentially the Antarctic , is changing rapidly , the question now is what the impacts will be . Why does it matter to us ? When it comes to the weather in the Arctic , it ’s the anti - Vegas , Meier said : “ What happens in the Arctic DOES NOT stay in the Arctic . ” The Arctic region impacts the weather in the rest of the planet – in particular , North America , Europe and Asia . During the Northern Hemisphere ’s winter , the arctic cold regularly “ spills out ” into the continents and can usher in major cold air outbreaks with crippling snow and ice storms , along with dangerously cold temperatures . Usually , this is regulated by the polar vortex that circles the North Pole several miles up in the stratosphere – not to be confused with the “ polar vortex ” nickname that ’s been attached to every cold snap and snowstorm in recent years . Any change in the polar vortex would mean a change in the frequency and intensity of winter storms in the areas where most people live . Researchers are looking at one such theory , which considers a warm Arctic and cold continents – basically , a warmer Arctic featuring less sea ice that leads to more frequent spilling of cold air that ’s normally trapped by the polar vortex . That would mean the continents are hit with more frequent shots of Arctic air . Even though that Arctic air might not be as cold as normal , it is still plenty frigid to wreak havoc on populated places , locking them into long cold spells and major snow storms . There ’s a classic example of it happening right now . Large swaths of Europe and Asia have seen bitter cold and record snows over the past several weeks , all while the Arctic was bathing in temperatures 30 degrees Fahrenheit above average . It ’s far too early to tell if what we are seeing in the Arctic , and now the Antarctic , is a sharp shift towards warmer poles with less ice . Scientists are quick to point out that weather in these regions can change quickly , but this is another expected result of climate change . And enough examples can become trends – and trends can have consequences .",['Sound_reasoning']

The White Cliffs of Dover are tumbling into the sea and causing sea levels to rise . Global warming is helping grow the Antarctic ice sheet . Those are some of the skeptical assertions echoed by Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Science , Space and Technology Committee yesterday . The lawmakers at times embraced research that questions mainstream climate science during a hearing on how technology can be used to address global warming . A leading climate scientist testifying before the panel spent much of the two hours correcting misstatements . The purpose of the hearing was to focus on how technology could be deployed for climate change adaptation . But the hearing frequently turned to the basics of climate science . Many of the questions by Republicans and Democrats alike were directed to Philip Duffy , president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts and former senior adviser to the U.S. Global Change Research Program . Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( R - CA ) said he was bothered that established climate science has not been questioned more by the committee , which has accused federal climate scientists of fraudulently manipulating climate data and subpoenaed their records . "" I 'm a little bit disturbed by , No . 1 , over and over again , I hear , ' Do n't ever talk about whether mankind is the main cause of the temperature changing and the climate changing , ' "" he said . "" That 's a little disturbing to hear constantly beaten into our heads in a Science Committee meeting , when basically we should all be open to different points of view . "" Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - TX ) , chairman of the committee , entered into the record an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that claimed sea levels are not rising because of climate change , a view that rejects thousands of scientific studies . The piece was written by Fred Singer , who is affiliated with the Heartland Institute in Chicago , Illinois , which promotes the rejection of mainstream climate science . "" To solve climate change challenges , we first need to acknowledge the uncertainties that exist , "" Smith said in his opening remarks . "" Then we can have confidence that innovations and technology will enable us to mitigate any adverse consequences of climate change . "" At one point , Smith showed a slide of two charts that he said demonstrated how the rate of sea - level rise does not equal the sharp spike in the consumption of fossil fuels . When Smith pointed out that rates of sea - level rise have only increased slightly compared with the rate of fossil fuel use , Duffy pointed out that his chart was from a single tide gauge station , near San Francisco , and that sea levels rise at different rates around the world . Smith did not show rising atmospheric CO2 levels or temperatures , both of which have climbed steadily in recent decades as emissions have increased . "" The rate of global sea - level rise has accelerated and is now four times faster than it was 100 years ago , "" Duffy told Smith in response to the charts . "" Is this chart inaccurate , then ? "" Smith asked . "" It 's accurate , but it does n't represent what 's happening globally ; it represents what 's happening in San Francisco , "" Duffy said . Rep. Mo Brooks ( R - AL ) questioned Duffy on the factors that contribute to sea - level rise , pointing out that land subsidence plays a role , as well as human activity . Brooks then said that erosion plays a significant role in sea - level rise , which is not an idea embraced by mainstream climate researchers . He said the California coastline and the White Cliffs of Dover tumble into the sea every year , and that contributes to sea - level rise . He also said that silt washing into the ocean from the world 's major rivers , including the Mississippi , the Amazon and the Nile , is contributing to sea - level rise . "" Every time you have that soil or rock or whatever it is that is deposited into the seas , that forces the sea levels to rise , because now you have less space in those oceans , because the bottom is moving up , "" Brooks said . Duffy responded : "" I 'm pretty sure that on human time scales , those are minuscule effects . "" Brooks added that Antarctic ice is growing . That was true a few years ago , and scientists say it does not disprove the theory of global warming because different factors affect the Arctic and Antarctic rates of melting . "" We have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage , "" Duffy said . "" I 'm sorry , but I do n't know where you 're getting your information , but the data I have seen suggests — "" Brooks said . Duffy answered : "" The National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . "" "" Well , I 've got a NASA base in my district , and apparently , they 're telling you one thing and me a different thing , "" Brooks said . "" But there are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet , particularly that above land , is increasing , not decreasing . Now , you could make a different argument if you want to talk about Greenland or the Arctic . "" Earlier this year , NASA researchers determined that Antarctica 's ice loss has accelerated in the last decade . More broadly , sea ice extent at both poles set a record low last year . Scientists are racing to better understand the changes occurring in Antarctica because much of its ice is land - based , meaning it could drive sea - level rise around the world as it melts .

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-accurately-assesses-the-state-of-alaskan-permafrost-henry-fountain/,"YUKON DELTA NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE , Alaska — The Arctic is warming about twice as fast as other parts of the planet , and even here in sub - Arctic Alaska the rate of warming is high . Sea ice and wildlife habitat are disappearing ; higher sea levels threaten coastal native villages . But to the scientists from Woods Hole Research Center who have come here to study the effects of climate change , the most urgent is the fate of permafrost , the always - frozen ground that underlies much of the state . Starting just a few feet below the surface and extending tens or even hundreds of feet down , it contains vast amounts of carbon in organic matter — plants that took carbon dioxide from the atmosphere centuries ago , died and froze before they could decompose . Worldwide , permafrost is thought to contain about twice as much carbon as is currently in the atmosphere . Once this ancient organic material thaws , microbes convert some of it to carbon dioxide and methane , which can flow into the atmosphere and cause even more warming . Scientists have estimated that the process of permafrost thawing could contribute as much as 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit to global warming over the next several centuries , independent of what society does to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels and other activities . In Alaska , nowhere is permafrost more vulnerable than here , 350 miles south of the Arctic Circle , in a vast , largely treeless landscape formed from sediment brought down by two of the state ’s biggest rivers , the Yukon and the Kuskokwim . Temperatures three feet down into the frozen ground are less than half a degree below freezing . This area could lose much of its permafrost by midcentury . That , said Max Holmes , senior scientist and deputy director of the research center , “ has all kinds of consequences both locally for this region , for the animals and the people who live here , as well as globally . ” “ It ’s sobering to think of this magnificent landscape and how fundamentally it can change over a relatively short time period , ” he added . But on this wide , flat tundra , it takes a practiced eye to see how Alaska is thawing from below . At one of the countless small lakes that pepper the region , chunks of shoreline that include what had been permafrost have calved off toward the water . Nearby , across a spongy bed of mosses and lichens , a small boggy depression most likely formed when the ice in the top layers of the permafrost below it melted to water . In July , the Woods Hole scientists , along with 13 undergraduate and graduate students working on projects of their own , set up a temporary field station on a nameless lake 60 miles northwest of Bethel , which with a population of 6,000 is the largest town in the region . They drilled permafrost cores with a power auger , took other sediment and water samples and embedded temperature probes in the frozen ground . Later , back in the lab at Woods Hole , they began the process of analyzing the samples for carbon content and nutrients . The goal is to better understand how thawing permafrost affects the landscape and , ultimately , how much and what mix of greenhouse gases is released . “ In order to know how much is lost , you have to know how much is there , ” said Sue Natali , a Woods Hole scientist and permafrost expert . Even in colder northern Alaska , where permafrost in some parts of the North Slope extends more than 2,100 feet below the surface , scientists are seeing stark changes . Vladimir E. Romanovsky , a permafrost researcher at the University of Alaska , Fairbanks , said that temperatures at a depth of 65 feet have risen by 3 degrees Celsius ( about 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit ) over decades . Near - surface changes have been even greater . At one northern site , he said , permafrost temperatures at shallow depths have climbed from minus 8 degrees Celsius to minus 3 . “ Minus 3 is not that far from zero , ” Dr. Romanovsky said . If emissions and warming continue at the same rate , he said , near - surface temperatures will rise above freezing around the middle of the century . There is plenty of debate among scientists about when and how much of Alaska ’s permafrost will thaw . And there is no doubt that thawing of the full depth of permafrost would take millenniums . But Dr. Romanovsky said that his and others ’ work shows that permafrost “ is not as stable as people thought . ” In addition to greenhouse gas emissions , thawing wreaks havoc on infrastructure , causing slumping of land when ice loses volume as it turns to water . The main road in Bethel , where average temperatures have risen about 4 degrees Fahrenheit since the mid-20th century , is more of a washboard than a thoroughfare because of shifting ground . Building foundations in Bethel move and crack as well . Some roads , airport runways and parking areas have to be reinforced with liquid - filled pipes that transfer heat out of the permafrost to keep the ground from slumping . The thawing of permafrost is a gradual process . Ground is fully frozen in winter , and begins to thaw from the top down as air temperatures rise in spring . As average temperatures increase over years , this thawed , or active , layer can increase in depth . At the field station , the researchers are especially interested in how wildfires affect the permafrost . Because burning removes some of the vegetation that acts as insulation , the theory is that burning should cause permafrost to thaw more .",['Sound_reasoning']

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/big-melt-global-sea-ice-record-low-usa-today-doyle-rice/,"There is now less sea ice on Earth than at any time on record . Ice in the Arctic and Antarctic melted to record low levels in January , scientists reported this week . Sea ice is frozen ocean water that melts during the summer and refreezes in winter . It floats on top of the ocean . Arctic sea ice this January averaged 5.17 million square miles , the lowest for the month in the 38 - year sea ice record , the National Snow and Ice Data Center said . That is 100,000 square miles less than the previous January record low set just last year . January air temperatures climbed above average over nearly all of the Arctic Ocean , NASA said , continuing a pattern that started in fall . In some parts of the Arctic , temperatures reached a whopping 9 degrees above average for the month . At the bottom of the world , sea ice is also at all - time record low levels around Antarctica , the data center said . The lack of ice in the Antarctic , where it is currently summer , is most pronounced in the Amundsen Sea , where only a few scattered patches of ice remain . Sea ice in the Arctic affects wildlife such as polar bears , seals and walruses . It also helps regulate the planet ’s temperature by influencing the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean . It can affect weather in the U.S. The amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic has steadily declined over the past few decades because of man - made global warming , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . "" Greenhouse gases emitted through human activities and the resulting increase in global mean temperatures are the most likely underlying cause of the sea ice decline , "" the snow and ice data center said . Sea ice thickness also substantially declined in the latter half of the 20th century , the snow and ice data center said . Antarctic ice fluctuates wildly year to year , and the link to man - made global warming there is not clear , NASA ice expert Walt Meier said . Using paleoclimatic data , studies suggest sea ice is shrinking to levels not seen in thousands of years .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-sea-level-rise-cities-fails-make-timescale-clear/,"When UN climate negotiators meet for summit talks this month , there will be a new figure on the table : 3C. Until now , global efforts such as the Paris climate agreement have tried to limit global warming to 2C above pre - industrial levels . However , with latest projections pointing to an increase of 3.2C by 2100 , these goals seem to be slipping out of reach . Global temperature change compared to pre - industrial levels “ [ We ] still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future , ” said Erik Solheim , the UN environment chief , ahead of the upcoming Bonn conference . One of the biggest resulting threats to cities around the world is sea - level rise , caused by the expansion of water at higher temperatures and melting ice sheets on the north and south poles . Scientists at the non - profit organisation Climate Central estimate that 275 million people worldwide live in areas that will eventually be flooded at 3C of global warming . Asian cities will be worst affected The regional impact of these changes is highly uneven , with four out of five people affected living in Asia . Although sea levels will not rise instantaneously , the calculated increases will be “ locked in ” at a temperature rise of 3C , meaning they will be irreversible even if warming eventually slows down . Osaka , Japan 5.2 million people affected At the end of a month in which it has been battered by unseasonably late typhoons and relentless rain , Japan is already confronting the threat posed by climate change - induced flooding . Image modelling shows that swaths of Osaka – the commercial heart of a region whose GDP is almost as big as that of the Netherlands – would disappear beneath the water in a 3C world , threatening the local economy and almost a third of the wider region ’s 19 million residents . Millions of people live in the urban area surrounding Osaka . Sea - level rise will reshape densely and sparsely populated areas . As a result of global sea - level rise , storm surges and other factors , economists project that coastal flooding could put almost $ 1tn of Osaka ’s assets at risk by the 2070s , according to the Union of Concerned Scientists . “ The costs of protecting cities from rising sea levels and storms are also likely to rise - as are the costs of repairing storm damage , ” it said . “ Decisions we make today could have a profound impact on the security and culture of the people of this ancient city . ” Like much of Japan , Osaka already has a network of seawalls and other coastal defences in place to combat tsunami – although their effectiveness was disputed in the aftermath of the 2011 triple disaster . Osaka city authorities are investing in other infrastructure to mitigate the effects of flooding , but public education is also vital , according to Toshikazu Nakaaki of the Osaka municipal government ’s environment bureau . “ In the past our response was focused on reducing the causes of global warming , but given that climate change is inevitable , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , we are now discussing how to respond to the natural disasters that will follow , ” Nakaaki said . “ We anticipate that Osaka will be affected by natural disasters caused by climate change , but we have yet to establish exactly what might happen or how much financial damage they would cause . “ It ’s not that we expect sea levels to rise at some point in the future – they are already rising . ” Keiko Kanai has long been aware that her home city is susceptible to natural disasters . “ I ’d heard that historically , tsunamis caused by earthquakes put many parts of Osaka underwater , and I knew that some parts of the world were at risk from rising sea levels , ” said Kanai , who teaches at a local university . “ But I did n’t put two and two together . Until now I have n’t given much thought to the idea that Osaka too could be engulfed by rising sea levels . ” Kaori Akazawa , a nursing care consultant , said flooding was a consideration when she was deciding where in Osaka to live . “ When I moved here I talked to my colleagues about the risks , ” she said . “ That ’s why I ’ve always rented apartments on the fourth storey or higher . “ It ’s worrying , but I ’ve never considered moving . ” Justin McCurry in Tokyo Alexandria , Egypt 3 million people affected On the Alexandria Corniche , waves slowly lap at a shoreline dotted with plastic chairs and umbrellas from the beachside cafes . Students perch on the steps of the imposing Alexandria library . But the same coastline that draws locals to its scenic vistas is threatening to slowly engulf the historic city as sea levels rise due to global warming . The IPCC reported that Alexandria ’s beaches would be submerged even with a 0.5 - metre sea - level rise , while 8 million people would be displaced by flooding in Alexandria and the Nile Delta if no protective measures are taken . A 3C world threatens far greater damage than that . Yet for many residents , there is little public information to connect the increasingly chaotic weather and floods with climate change . “ The vast majority of Alexandrians do n’t have access to knowledge , and that ’s what worries me .

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/daily-caller-uncritically-reports-misleading-satellite-temperature-study-michael-bastasch/,"Global warming has not accelerated temperature rise in the bulk atmosphere in more than two decades , according to a new study funded by the Department of Energy . University of Alabama - Huntsville climate scientists John Christy and Richard McNider found that by removing the climate effects of volcanic eruptions early on in the satellite temperature record it showed virtually no change in the rate of warming since the early 1990s . “ We indicated 23 years ago — in our 1994 Nature article — that climate models had the atmosphere ’s sensitivity to CO2 much too high , ” Christy said in a statement . “ This recent paper bolsters that conclusion . ” Christy and McNider found the rate of warming has been 0.096 degrees Celsius per decade after “ the removal of volcanic cooling in the early part of the record , ” which “ is essentially the same value we determined in 1994 … using only 15 years of data . ” The study is sure to be contentious . Christy has argued for years that climate models exaggerate global warming in the bulk atmosphere , which satellites have monitored since the late 1970s . Christy , a noted skeptic of catastrophic man - made global warming , said his results reinforce his claim that climate models predict too much warming in the troposphere , the lowest five miles of the atmosphere . Models are too sensitive to increases in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere , he said . “ From our observations we calculated that value as 1.1 C ( almost 2 ° Fahrenheit ) , while climate models estimate that value as 2.3 C ( about 4.1 ° F ) , ” Christy said . While many scientists have acknowledged the mismatch between model predictions and actual temperature observations , few have really challenged the validity of the models themselves . A recent study led by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory climate scientist Ben Santer found that while the models ran hot , the “ overestimation ” was “ partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations . ” Christy ’s removal of volcanic - driven cooling from satellite temperature data could also draw scrutiny . The study also removed El Nino and La Nina cycles , which are particularly pronounced in satellite records , but those cycles largely canceled each other out , the co - authors said . Christy said his works shows the “ climate models need to be retooled to better reflect conditions in the actual climate , while policies based on previous climate model output and predictions might need to be reconsidered . ” Two major volcanoes — El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991 — caused global average temperature to dip as a result of volcanic ash , soot and debris reflecting sunlight back into space . Those eruptions meant there was more subsequent warming in the following years , making the rate of warming appear to be rising as a result of man - made emissions or other factors , Christy said . “ Those eruptions happened relatively early in our study period , which pushed down temperatures in the first part of the dataset , which caused the overall record to show an exaggerated warming trend , ” Christy said . “ While volcanic eruptions are natural events , it was the timing of these that had such a noticeable effect on the trend . If the same eruptions had happened near the more recent end of the dataset , they could have pushed the overall trend into negative numbers , or a long - term cooling , ” Christy said .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scientists-officially-declare-2016-hottest-year-record-chris-mooney-the-washington-post/,"In a powerful testament to the warming of the planet , two leading U.S. science agencies Wednesday jointly declared 2016 the hottest year on record , surpassing the previous record set just last year — which itself had topped a record set in 2014 . Average surface temperatures in 2016 , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , were 0.07 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than 2015 and featured eight successive months ( January through August ) that were individually the warmest since the agency ’s records began in 1880 . The average temperature across the world ’s land and ocean surfaces was 58.69 Fahrenheit , or 1.69 degrees above the 20th - century average of 57 degrees , NOAA declared . The agency also noted that the record for the global temperature has now successively been broken five times since the year 2000 . The years 2005 and 2010 were also record warm years , according to the agency ’s data set . NASA concurred with NOAA , also declaring 2016 the warmest year on record in its own data set that tracks the temperatures at the surface of the planet ’s land and oceans , and expressing “ greater than 95 percent certainty ” in that conclusion . ( In contrast , NOAA gave a 62 percent confidence in the broken record . ) NASA found a bigger leap upward of temperatures in 2016 , measuring the year as .22 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the prior record year of 2015 . The agency also noted that since the year 2001 , the planet has seen “ 16 of the 17 warmest years on record . ” Last year “ is remarkably the third record year in a row in this series , ” said Gavin Schmidt , who directs NASA ’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies , in a statement . “ We do n’t expect record years every year , but the ongoing long - term warming trend is clear . ” The record comes two days before Donald Trump , who has tweeted that global warming is a “ hoax , ” assumes the presidency and , with it , control over the two science agencies that announced these records . It is also the same day that Scott Pruitt , Trump ’s controversial nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency , is appearing before the Senate in an often - tense confirmation hearing in which he has been questioned about climate change . Pruitt has previously written that the “ debate ” over climate change is “ far from settled . ” Trump ’s other nominees , such as State Department nominee Rex Tillerson and Interior Department nominee Ryan Zinke , have been less dismissive of climate change in their confirmation hearings , acknowledging at least some human contribution to the phenomenon but also raising questions either about the extent to which it is human - caused or about our capacity to predict the consequences . On Wednesday , Pruitt acknowledged that climate change is not a “ hoax ” and said that “ the climate is changing , and human activity contributes to that in some manner . ” Scientists have been far less guarded . “ 2016 is a wake - up call in many ways , ” Jonathan Overpeck , a climate scientist at the University of Arizona , said of the year ’s temperatures . “ Climate change is real , it is caused by humans , and it is serious . ” NASA and NOAA produce slightly different records using somewhat different methodologies , but have now concurred on identifying 2014 , 2015 and 2016 as , successively , the three warmest years in their records . There was a noticeable difference this year , however , in how much two agencies judged 2016 to have surpassed 2015 . NASA was more bullish — a difference that Schmidt , in a press call Wednesday , attributed to different ways of measuring the Arctic . “ The warming in the Arctic has really been exceptional , and what you decide to do when you ’re interpolating across the Arctic makes a difference , ” Schmidt said . But the differences between NOAA and NASA are n’t that significant , Schmidt further argued , in the context of the bigger picture . “ Getting hung up on the exact nature of the records is interesting , and there ’s lots of technical work that can be done there , but the main take - home response there is that the trends we ’ve been seeing since the 1970s are continuing and have not paused in any way , ” he said . Here ’s a NASA figure showing that long term trend , now updated through 2016 : Last year ’s warmth was partly enhanced by a strong weather pattern known as El Niño , but the federal scientists underscore that this was not the only cause . For example , 1998 was also , at the time , the warmest year on record , thanks in part to a strong El Niño — but the 2016 planetary temperature now far surpasses the temperature of that year , as you can see above . The reason is that Earth has been warming since then , allowing another El Niño event , unlocking heat from the vast Pacific Ocean , to push overall temperatures to new heights . “ This El Niño might have contributed about a quarter or a third ” of the record in 2016 , said Deke Arndt , chief of the global monitoring branch at NOAA ’s National Centers for Environmental Information , on a press call Wednesday . Thus do natural wobbles of the planet ’s temperature interact with an overall warming trend to produce records on a regular basis . At present , that means that while scientists would expect 2017 to be quite warm , relative to , say , a year in the 1990s , there has been little talk of a fourth record year in a row . And , indeed , El Niño has subsided . Two other global agencies , the Japan Meteorological Agency and Britain ’s Hadley Center , also track global temperatures .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/matthew-francis-forbes-even-without-drastic-predictions-coasts-are-in-danger/,"As the world warms , more and more coastlines are under threat from flooding . Melting ice in the Arctic and Antarctic regions , along with warming ocean waters , are already producing noticeable rises in sea levels . That much is uncontroversial among scientists , and sea - level rise is a major worry for people living in coastal cities and on islands . A new paper by prominent climate scientist James Hansen and colleagues says even a moderate increase in global temperatures could lead to much greater sea level rise than the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report predicts . Since the IPCC report ( last published in 2013 ) is based on the work of thousands of climate researchers , many people are skeptical of the new paper . Again , this is n't because they doubt climate change is real or that sea - level rise is a big problem . Instead , the critics ' concerns are about the details of the model Hansen and his coauthors use . Based on current trends , Hansen and colleagues modeled how quickly ocean levels are rising . They considered the rate of ice sheet melting in Greenland and Antarctica , along with increases in water temperature . Comparing those present data to models of climate and ocean levels in ancient times , they conclude sea levels could rise several meters in the next century . That catastrophic increase would happen even if global temperatures are held to the conservative limit of 2 ° Celsius increase , proposed as a reasonable goal by many agencies . The broad outlines of the paper are within the norm for climate research , but the details are at odds with other studies . The obvious disagreement is the amount of sea level rise , which in this paper is a much higher rate of increase than other models show . Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) writes that the new paper mishandles important short - term climate fluctuations such as the El Niño phenomenon , which can make individual years much warmer than the average . In other words , record - breaking temperatures this year are specifically from El Niño , but the general increase in global temperatures is part of the trend due to climate change . James Hansen is well known for his role in bringing scientists ' worries over climate change to a much wider audience , when he testified before Congress in 1988 . He has stated that this new paper could be his most important work , an understandable sentiment . If the results of this paper are true , then rapid sea - level rise will disrupt the lives of huge numbers of people around the world , and governments need to take action immediately . But that of course is where things can get sticky . Historically , climate scientists have been more conservative than not in making public statements to avoid alarmism and giving fuel to powerful denialist voices . They may not have science on their side , but those who claim either that climate change is n't real or say it 's not a big problem have a lot of money and media platforms . The deniers happily pounce on any tiny misstep , real or perceived , by climate researchers and those of us who report on their findings . Another paper , published yesterday in Nature , had less fanfare than the Hansen paper , but shows the severe danger of flooding in coastal regions , particularly in the United States . This risk is n't directly from sea - level rise , but from the intensification of storm surges and increased precipitation that are secondary effects of climate change . Flooding risk in any particular place depends on a number of factors : the flatness of land right by the water , how steep the continental shelf is off the coast , the number and severity of storms , etc . That 's why much of the state of Florida is at greater risk than coastal cities in California . As the Nature paper shows , heavier rainfall combines with storm surges , the rush of water toward the shore during major storms , to amplify flooding . That combination is deadly : thanks to sea - level rise due to climate change , flooding is going to get much worse . To put it another way : we do n't need the ocean to rise several meters to create severe floods . The next decade of "" normal "" hurricanes and tropical storms could bring the effects of climate change right into coastal cities . Updated : I stated initially that extreme storms will increase in frequency and severity , which is not a claim made by the authors of the Nature paper . Rather , usual storms at their regular frequency are enough of a problem , especially when coupled with sea - level rise . About 40 percent of the population of the United States lives in coastal counties , and many of the world 's major cities are similarly close to the ocean .

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/breitbart-article-makes-numerous-false-claims-about-the-impacts-of-climate-change-based-on-global-warming-policy-foundation-post-delingpole-goklany/,"There is no “ climate emergency ” , according to a study for the Global Warming Policy Foundation by independent scientist Dr Indur Goklany . Goklany concludes : While climate may have changed for the warmer : • Most extreme weather phenomena have not become more extreme , more deadly , or more destructive • Empirical evidence directly contradicts claims that increased carbon dioxide has reduced human wellbeing . In fact , human wellbeing has never been higher • Whatever detrimental effects warming and higher carbon dioxide may have had on terrestrial species and ecosystems , they have been swamped by the contribution of fossil fuels to increased biological productivity . This has halted , and turned around , reductions in habitat loss The report will make hugely depressing reading for all the prominent environmental activists — from the Pope and Doom Goblin Greta Thunberg to the Great Reset ’s Klaus Schwab — who have been pushing the “ climate emergency ” narrative . It is an article of faith for the globalist elite and their useful idiots in the media , in politics , in business , and the entertainment that the world is on course for climate disaster which only radical and costly international action can prevent . But Goklany ’s report — Impacts of Climate Change : Perception & Reality — claims there is little if any evidence to support the scare narrative . At the end , Goklany provides a table , setting out all the scaremongering claims made by environmental groups — and then comparing them with observed reality . Only one of the claims stands up , according to the study — weather has been getting slightly warmer : More hot days and fewer cold days — Yes Cyclones / hurricanes more intense or frequent — No Tornadoes increase and become more intense — No Floods more frequent and more intense — No Droughts more frequent and intense — No Area burned by wildfire increasing — No ( area peaked in mid-19th century ) Cereal yields decreasing — No ( they have tripled since 1961 ) Food supplies per capita decreasing — No ( increased 31 per cent since 1961 ) Land area and beaches shrinking , coral islands submerged — No . ( Marginal expansion ) None of the doom - mongering claims made about a decline in human welfare stands up , either , according to the study . Access to cleaner water has increased ; mortality from ‘ Extreme Weather Events ’ has declined by 99 per cent since the 1920s ; fewer people are dying from heat ; death rates from climate - sensitive diseases like malaria and diarrhoea have decreased ( since 1900 malaria death rates have declined 96 per cent ) ; hunger rates have declined ; poverty has declined ( GDP per capita has quadrupled since 1950 even as CO2 levels have sextupled ) ; life expectancy has more than doubled since the start of industrialisation ; health adjusted life expectancy has increased ; global inequality has decreased in terms of incomes , life expectancies and access to modern - day amenities ; the earth is green and more productive ; habitat lost to agriculture has peaked due to fossil fuel dependent technologies . It will be hard for green activists to dismiss Goklany as a “ denier ” . His credentials as a climate expert are impeccable . He was a member of the U.S. delegation that established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and helped develop its First Assessment Report . He subsequently served as a U.S. delegate to the IPCC , and as an IPCC reviewer . Goklany says : Almost everywhere you look , climate change is having only small , and often benign , impacts . The impact of extreme weather events ― hurricanes , tornadoes , floods and droughts ― are , if anything , declining . Economic damages have declined as a fraction of global GDP . Death rates from such events have declined by 99 % since the 1920s . Climate - related disease has collapsed . And more people die from cold than warm temperatures . Even sea - level rise — predicted to be the most damaging impact of global warming — seems to be much less of a problem than thought , according to to the study ’s findings . Goklany says : A recent study showed that the Earth has actually gained more land in coastal areas in the last 30 years than it has lost through sea - level rise . We now know for sure that coral atolls are n’t disappearing and even Bangladesh is gaining more land through siltation than it is losing through rising seas . In his report , Goklany destroys many of the green movement ’s shibboleths , including the notion that fossil fuels are bad for the planet . Not only , he suggests , has their CO2 contributed to “ global greening ” — “ contrary to prevailing wisdom , tree cover globally has increased by over 2 million km2 between 1982 and 2016 , an increase of 7 per cent ” — but they provide the fertilisers and pesticides which simultaneously feed the planet and reduce the amount of land required for agriculture : Thus , nitrogen fertilisers and carbon dioxide fertilisation have together increased global food production by 111 per cent . In other words , fossil fuels are responsible for more than half of global food production . Without them , food would be scarcer , and prices higher ( assuming all else , including food demand , stays constant ) . To maintain the food supply , croplands would have to more than double , to at least 26 per cent of the world ’s land area ( ex - Antarctica ) . Adding in pastureland , the human footprint on the planet would increase to 51.2 per cent of the world . In other words , fossil fuels have saved 13.8 per cent of the non - frozen parts of the world from being converted to agriculture . At the beginning , he quotes a number of climate doom - mongers , including the Pope .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Inaccurate']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/james-lovelock-interview-by-end-of-century-robots-will-have-taken-over-decca-aitkenhead-the-guardian/,"James Lovelock ’s parting words last time we met were : “ Enjoy life while you can . Because if you ’re lucky , it ’s going to be 20 years before it hits the fan . ” It was early 2008 , and the distinguished scientist was predicting imminent and irreversible global warming , which would soon make large parts of the planet uninhabitably hot or put them underwater . The fashionable hope that windfarms or recycling could prevent global famine and mass migration was , he assured me , a fantasy ; it was too late for ethical consumption to save us . Before the end of this century , 80 % of the world ’s population would be wiped out . His predictions were not easy to forget or dismiss . Sometimes described as a futurist , Lovelock has been Britain ’s leading independent scientist for more than 50 years . His Gaia hypothesis , which contends that the earth is a single , self - regulating organism , is now accepted as the founding principle of most climate science , and his invention of a device to detect CFCs helped identify the hole in the ozone layer . A defiant generalist in an era of increasingly specialised study , and a mischievous provocateur , Lovelock is regarded by many as a scientific genius . Eight years after our previous encounter , he appears to have aged not one bit . At 97 , he ’s conceived a beautifully illustrated book of essays described as a “ tool kit for the future ” , The Earth and I , and written the introduction and conclusion ; he goes walking every day , his hearing is perfect , his focus forensic and his memory unimpaired . “ Yes , why not ? I ’m writing a fiction book at the moment . It ’s tremendous fun , you know . ” He applies his holistic philosophy of science to his own health . “ I ’m a firm believer that if you do n’t use it , you lose it – and if you do a lot of walking , and if you use your muscles quite a bit , your brain seems to work as well . You ’ve got to look at the whole system , not just bits of it . ” What has changed dramatically , however , is his position on climate change . He now says : “ Anyone who tries to predict more than five to 10 years is a bit of an idiot , because so many things can change unexpectedly . ” But is n’t that exactly what he did last time we met ? “ I know , ” he grins teasingly . “ But I ’ve grown up a bit since then . ” Lovelock now believes that “ CO2 is going up , but nowhere near as fast as they thought it would . The computer models just were n’t reliable . In fact , ” he goes on breezily , “ I ’m not sure the whole thing is n’t crazy , this climate change . You ’ve only got to look at Singapore . It ’s two - and - a - half times higher than the worst - case scenario for climate change , and it ’s one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in . ” There are various possible explanations for his change of heart . One is that Lovelock is right , and the models on which his former predictions were based were fatally flawed . Another is that his iconoclastic sensibility made revision irresistible . An incorrigible subversive , Lovelock was warning the world about climate change for decades before it began to pay attention , and just when the scientific consensus began to call for intervention to prevent it , he decided we were already too late . But there is a third explanation for why he has shifted his position again , and nowadays feels “ laid back about climate change ” . All things being equal – “ and it ’s only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models , everything else , is right off the board ” – he expects that before the consequences of global warming can impact on us significantly , something else will have made our world unrecognisable , and threaten the human race . Lovelock maintains that , unlike most environmentalists , he is a rigorous empiricist , but it is manifestly clear that he enjoys maddening the green movement . “ Well , it ’s a religion , really , you see . It ’s totally unscientific . ” He was once invited to Buckingham Palace , where he told Princess Anne : “ Your brother nearly killed me . ” Having read that Prince Charles had installed grass - burning boilers at Highgrove , Lovelock had tried one in his house . “ It ’s supposed to smoulder and keep the place warm ; but it does n’t , because it goes out , and clouds and clouds of smoke come out . ” He giggles . “ Princess Anne thought this was hilariously funny . ” Lovelock had been trying to heat his old mill in Devon , where he lived for more than 35 years , inventing contraptions in a workshop that resembled a Doctor Who set . He and his wife recently packed up his life ’s work and downsized to a remote cottage on Chesil Beach in Dorset , after the bill to heat the mill for just six months hit £ 6,000 . “ I remember George Monbiot took me up on it and wrote that it was impossible , that I had to be lying . But I was n’t lying , I ’ve got the figures . ” Monbiot does n’t quite accuse him of lying , in fairness ; just of “ talking rubbish ” and “ making wild statements ” . In any case , he says that in the US he found he could heat a house for six months , in temperatures of -20C ( -4F ) , for just £ 60 . As a result , he has withering contempt for environmentalists ’ opposition to fracking . “ You see , gas in America is incredibly cheap , because of fracking , ” he says . But what about the risk of triggering earthquakes ? He rolls his eyes .","['Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Inaccurate']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-news-coverage-2016-global-temperature-data-accurate-summary-justin-gillis/,"Marking another milestone for a changing planet , scientists reported on Wednesday that the Earth reached its highest temperature on record in 2016 , trouncing a record set only a year earlier , which beat one set in 2014 . It is the first time in the modern era of global warming data that temperatures have blown past the previous record three years in a row . The findings come two days before the inauguration of an American president who has called global warming a Chinese plot and vowed to roll back his predecessor ’s efforts to cut emissions of heat - trapping gases . In reality , the Earth is heating up , a point long beyond serious scientific dispute , but one becoming more evident as the records keep falling . Temperatures are heading toward levels that many experts believe will pose a profound threat to both the natural world and to human civilization . In 2015 and 2016 , the planetary warming was intensified by the weather pattern known as El Niño , in which the Pacific Ocean released a huge burst of energy and water vapor into the atmosphere . But the bigger factor in setting the records was the long - term trend of rising temperatures , which scientists say is being driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases . “ A single warm year is something of a curiosity , ” said Deke Arndt , chief of global climate monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . “ It ’s really the trend , and the fact that we ’re punching at the ceiling every year now , that is the real indicator that we ’re undergoing big changes . ” The heat extremes were especially pervasive in the Arctic , with temperatures in the fall running 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across large stretches of the Arctic Ocean . Sea ice in that region has been in precipitous decline for years , and Arctic communities are already wrestling with enormous problems , such as rapid coastal erosion , caused by the changing climate . “ What ’s going on in the Arctic is really very impressive ; this year was ridiculously off the chart , ” said Gavin A. Schmidt , head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan , a unit of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that tracks global temperatures . But Arctic people were hardly alone in feeling the heat . Drought and starvation afflicted Africa . On May 19 , the people in the town of Phalodi lived through the hottest day in the recorded history of India , 123.8 degrees Fahrenheit . El Niño has now ended , and climate scientists almost universally expect 2017 to be cooler than the year before . But the scale of the heat burst has been startling to many of the experts , and some of them fear an accelerated era of global warming could be at hand over the next few years . Even at current temperatures , billions of tons of land ice are melting or sliding into the ocean . The sea is also absorbing most of the heat trapped by human emissions . Those factors are causing the ocean to rise at what appears to be an accelerating pace , and coastal communities in the United States are beginning to spend billions to fight increased tidal flooding . Their pleas for help from Congress have largely been ignored . The finding that a record had been set for the third year in a row was released on Wednesday by three government agencies , two of them American and one British , that track measurements made by ships , buoys and land - based weather stations . They analyze the figures to correct for known problems , producing an annual average temperature for the surface of the Earth . The national meteorological agency of Japan confirmed the findings in a preliminary analysis . In the British data set , 2016 set a record by only a small amount ; the margin was larger in the NOAA data set and larger still in NASA ’s . NASA does more work than the other groups to take full account of Arctic temperatures , and several scientists said they believed the NASA record to be the most accurate for 2016 for that reason . NASA ’s calculations suggested that the planet had warmed by well over a half - degree Fahrenheit from 2013 to 2016 . That is a huge change for the surface of an entire planet to undergo in just three years , and it appears to be the largest temperature increase over a three - year period in the NASA record , which begins in 1880 . The findings about a record - warm year were also confirmed by the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project , a nonprofit California group set up to provide a temperature analysis independent of governments . That group , however , did not find that three records had been set in a row ; in its analysis , 2010 was slightly warmer than 2014 . In addition to the surface measurements , satellites are used to measure the temperature of the atmosphere within a few miles of the surface . Two groups that analyze these figures showed a record - warm 2016 in data going back to 1978 , though in one data set it was a record by only a small margin . Since 1880 , NOAA ’s records show only one other instance when global temperature records were set three years in a row : in 1939 , 1940 and 1941 . The Earth has warmed so much in recent decades , however , that 1941 now ranks as only the 37th - warmest year on record .",['Sound_reasoning']

The first is that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming . The second is that future climate can be predicted from computer models . It has yet to be shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive climate change . More than 100 climate models over the past 30 years did not predict what actually happened because it was assumed carbon dioxide had the pivotal role in driving climate change and that the effects of clouds , back - radiation and the sun were trivial . Climate projections also assume that planet Earth is not dynamic and that a temporary terrestrial vertebrate on an evolving planet can change major planetary and extraterrestrial systems . READ NEXT Overseas medicos on fly - in mission RACHEL BAXENDALE Unless the past is understood , climate projections can be only highly speculative . Even in our own lifetimes , there is no relationship between temperature and carbon dioxide emissions by ­humans , yet there is a very close relationship between solar activity and temperature . Since the beginning of time , water vapour has been the main greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide has had a minuscule effect on global climate . Carbon dioxide is a trace gas in the atmosphere . We are expected to believe that emission of traces of a trace gas into the atmosphere is a major planetary driving force . If the atmosphere comprised 85,000 molecules , the total carbon dioxide emissions added annually would be 33 molecules , of which only one molecule would be from human emissions and the other 32 from natural emissions . Do we really believe that one bellowing fan in a crowd of 85,000 at the MCG can completely change the course of a game ? READ MORE : Earth ‘ 2 degrees from hothouse ’ For the past 4567 million years , the sun and the Earth ’s orbit have driven climate change cycles . In the past , the atmospheric carbon dioxide content has been orders of magnitude higher than now , yet there were ice ages . We currently live in an interglacial during an ice age with alternating cycles of glaciations and interglacials . The current interglacial reached a peak about 5000 years ago . Since then , the planet has been cooling on a millennial scale and no amount of hot air , agreements , taxes , environmental wailing or legislation can change the fact that the Earth ’s orbit is slowly taking us farther from the sun . Just 1.25 per cent of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - ocean system has been released by ­humans in the past 250 years . The ­atmospheric residency time of carbon dioxide is five years and it is quickly sequestered into plants , marine life , oceans and sediments . If human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming , why have there been slight warmings and coolings since the Industrial Revolution ? Why is it that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming yet natural emissions do not ? Carbon dioxide is plant food . Horticulturalists pump warm carbon dioxide into glasshouses to stimulate growth . Over the past 30 years , planet Earth has greened due to a slight increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide . Without carbon dioxide , there would be no complex life on earth . It is neither pollution nor a poison , and in the past the atmospheric carbon dioxide content has varied enormously . When the atmospheric carbon dioxide content was low , plants struggled . When it was high , there was an expansion and increasing diversity of vegetation . In addition , when it was warm , life expanded , whereas when it was cold , life contracted . Over historical times , when it was cold there was human depopulation . When it was warm , economies thrived . Biological , geological and planetary systems are extremely robust . Our evolving dynamic planet has survived sea level changes of hundreds of metres , super volcanoes filling the atmosphere with dust , asteroid impacts , mass extinctions , ice ages and global warming . For most of time , Earth has been a warm , wet volcanic planet with no polar ice . Australia has uranium , coal and gas for generations . Fracking for tight gas and oil could further extend energy resources . We are the envy of the world . Australia once had cheap , reliable electricity and the states competed to provide cheap , long - term , reliable energy to attract industry . Illustration : Sturt Krygsman . Illustration : Sturt Krygsman . Now the states rely on the weather and compete to reach the bottom . South Australia is winning : it has the most unreliable grid in the world outside Africa and the most expensive electricity . When South Australians buy electricity at $ 14,200 / MWh , they are paying the equivalent of $ 400 a litre for petrol . As soon as the word emissions entered the language and became part of a religious ideology , electricity prices skyrocketed , electricity supply became more unreliable , subsidies for wind and solar energy went through the roof and employers and consumers had massive cost increases . Never mind that the emissions of carbon dioxide to make and maintain a wind or solar industrial complex are far greater than they will ever save . The Paris accord is non - binding . This is recognised by the major carbon dioxide emitters such as China , India and the US , which do n’t comply . No EU state has met its target . Why should Australia be the only country out of step and aim for an impossible , bankrupting reduction of 26 per cent or more of our 2005 carbon dioxide emissions ?

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/national-geographic-hurricanes-moving-slower-global-warming-craig-welch/,"Tropical cyclones , including hurricanes and typhoons , are now crawling across the planet at a slower pace than they did decades ago , dragging out and amplifying their devastation , new research published Wednesday shows . At the same time , related research published just last month suggests that warming temperatures from climate change will slow storms more in the future . While having a cyclone travel with less speed may seem like a good thing , it 's actually just the opposite . Wind speeds within the storm remain high , but the whole system itself moves slower across the landscape , allowing punishing rains to linger longer over communities . Taken together , these two studies suggest that climate change is already increasing the dangers posed by hurricanes and typhoons in far more ways than previously thought , and it will continue to compound many of the hazards , especially the threat of severe flooding . "" Nothing good comes out of a slowing storm , "" says James Kossin , with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Center for Weather and Climate in Madison , Wisconsin , and author of the first paper , published today in the journal Nature . "" It can increase storm surge . It can increase the amount of time that structures are subjected to strong wind . And it increases rainfall . "" Driving Devastation In the wake of Hurricane Harvey 's torrential rains , which dumped several feet of water on sections of Houston , Texas , last August , scientists showed that warmer sea and air temperatures pumped more moisture into the storm — which then fell as rain . Climate change increased both the intensity of the rainfall and the likelihood that the storm would occur . 13 Photos of Extreme Weather In his paper , Kossin found yet another way changes in storm patterns are sparking greater devastation . He showed that from 1949 to 2016 , tropical cyclones across the globe slowed their movement by 10 percent on average . In some regions , the pace of those storms slowed even more as they hit land . In the western North Pacific , the decline was almost a third . That means a storm that may already hold more moisture will have time to drop more of it in each spot . With the exception of the Indian Ocean region , which tends to behave differently , "" all the other regions show this consistent slowing , "" Kossin says . "" The trend is always in one direction . "" Kossin 's work was based on details of almost 70 years ' worth of storms , but he made no attempt to determine what was causing the slowdown . Still , the shift is precisely what he and other cyclone experts said would be expected from climate change . With polar regions warming faster than other parts of the globe , that is altering pressure gradients , reducing the winds that push these storms . "" Tropical cyclones are just carried along by the wind , so it makes sense , "" Kossin says . "" The storms will stay in your neighborhoods longer . "" Christina Patricola , a scientist with the climate and ecosystem sciences division of California 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , called Kossin 's work "" important and new "" and says she found it "" pretty convincing . "" "" I was not surprised by his findings , "" she says . "" But I was surprised by the magnitude of the slowdown . "" In an editorial accompanying Kossin 's work , she points out that it raises several new questions . For instance , if exceptionally slow - moving storms have grown more likely in recent years , does that mean "" stalled "" storms like Harvey — which seemed to get stuck in place for days — are increasing , too ? Kossi hopes that scientists will begin building models that show which communities are likely to face the most risk . Given that storms in some regions are migrating poleward and already increasing in intensity , cyclones delivering unusually powerful bouts of rain may threaten places not normally in their path . "" These are not good things to be combining , "" he says . Increasing Flooding ? In the second study , published in the Journal of Climate , a team led by Ethan Gutmann , with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , tried to see how 22 hurricanes that hit in the last 13 years might be different if they hit in the future under a warmer climate . By plugging storm data into computer models representing a future with temperatures that are up to five degrees warmer , they found that these cyclones moved 9 percent slower and were far , far wetter . Rainfall , on average , increased 24 percent . "" We 're showing that it not only slows down , but that it 's more intense , "" Gutmann says . "" That has serious implications for inland flooding and urban infrastructure . "" Gutmann and Kossin took entirely different approaches — one looking at historical data ; the other using modeling to see how storms would behave under predicted warming scenarios . And there are limits to each approach . No storm from today will reproduce in quite the same way in the future . But both scientists say the importance is in the bigger picture . The fact that their results show quite similar trends should be a wake - up call . "" We 're both pushing the work forward and adding additional lines of evidence , "" Gutmann says . "" And when you start getting more and more lines of evidence that all point in the same direction , you get more confident in the answers .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/environment-climate-change-records-broken-international-report-oliver-milman-the-guardian/,"The world is careening towards an environment never experienced before by humans , with the temperature of the air and oceans breaking records , sea levels reaching historic highs and carbon dioxide surpassing a key milestone , a major international report has found . The “ state of the climate ” report , led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) with input from hundreds of scientists from 62 countries , confirmed there was a “ toppling of several symbolic mileposts ” in heat , sea level rise and extreme weather in 2015 . “ The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle , ” Michael Mann , a leading climatologist at Penn State , told the Guardian . “ They are playing out before us , in real time . The 2015 numbers drive that home . ” Last year was the warmest on record , with the annual surface temperature beating the previous mark set in 2014 by 0.1C. This means that the world is now 1C warmer than it was in pre - industrial times , largely due to a huge escalation in the production of greenhouse gases . The UN has already said that 2016 is highly likely to break the annual record again , after 14 straight months of extreme heat aided by a hefty El Niño climatic event , a weather event that typically raises temperatures around the world . The oceans , which absorb more than 90 % of the extra CO2 pumped into the atmosphere , also reached a new record temperature , with sharp spikes in the El Niño - dominated eastern Pacific , which was 2C warmer than the long - term average , and the Arctic , where the temperature in August hit a dizzying 8C above average . The thermal expansion of the oceans , compounded by melting glaciers , resulted in the highest global sea level on record in 2015 . The oceans are around 70 mm higher than the 1993 average , which is when comprehensive satellite measurements of sea levels began . The seas are rising at an average rate of 3.3 mm a year , with the western Pacific and Indian Oceans experiencing the fastest increases . These changes are being driven by a CO2 concentration that surpassed the symbolic 400 parts per million mark at the Mauna Loa research station in Hawaii last year . The Noaa report states that the global CO2 level was a touch under this , at 399.4ppm , an increase of 2.2ppm compared to 2014 . Noaa said other “ remarkable ” changes in 2015 include the Arctic ’s lowest maximum sea ice extent in the 37 - year satellite record , recorded in February 2015 . The world ’s alpine glaciers recorded a net annual loss of ice for the 36th consecutive year and the Greenland ice sheet , which would balloon sea levels by around 7 m should it disintegrate , experienced melting over more than 50 % of its surface . The rapid changes in the climate may have profound consequences for humans and other species . In June last year , a severe heatwave claimed over 1,000 lives in Karachi , Pakistan . Severe drought caused food shortages for millions of people in Ethiopia , with a lack of rainfall resulting in “ intense and widespread ” forest fires in Indonesia that belched out a vast quantity of greenhouse gas . Diminishing sea ice is causing major walrus herds to haul themselves out on to land . Arctic marine species , such as snailfish and polar cod , are being pushed out of the region by species coming from further south , attracted to the warming waters . A huge algal bloom off the west coast of North America harmed marine life and fisheries . Scientists have said there were underlying climate change trends at play but last year was also influenced by the strong El Niño event , which is when equatorial Pacific waters warm , leading to an array of weather effects around the world . El Niño has also helped spur searing heat in 2016 but has now petered out . Thomas Karl , director of Noaa national centers for environmental information , said that last year ’s climate “ was shaped both by long - term change and an El Niño event . When we think about being climate resilient , both of these time scales are important to consider . “ Last year ’s El Niño was a clear reminder of how short - term events can amplify the relative influence and impacts stemming from longer - term warming trends . ” Kate Willett , a senior scientist at Britain ’s Met Office , said that there was a 75 % annual increase in the amount of land that experienced severe drought last year . “ Looking at a range of climate measurements , 2015 was yet another highly significant year , ” she said . “ Not only was 2015 the warmest year on record by a large margin , it was also another year when the levels of dominant greenhouse gases reached new peaks . ” The state of the climate report is now in its 26th year . The peer - reviewed series is published annually by the American Meteorological Society .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/investors-business-daily-editorial-misrepresents-study-to-claim-plants-will-prevent-dangerous-climate-change/,"Climate Change : Scientists just discovered a massive , heretofore unknown , source of nitrogen . Why does this matter ? Because it could dramatically change those dire global warming forecasts that everybody claims are based on "" settled science . "" The researchers , whose findings were published in the prestigious journal Science , say they 've determined that the idea that the only source of nitrogen for plant life came from the air is wrong . There are vast storehouses in the planet 's bedrock that plants also feed on . This is potentially huge news , since what it means is that there is a vastly larger supply of nitrogen than previously believed . University of California at Davis environmental scientist and co - author of the study , Ben Houlton , says that "" This runs counter the centuries - long paradigm that has laid the foundation for the environmental sciences . "" Pay close attention to the word "" paradigm . "" If Houlton 's finding about these vast , previously unknown nitrogen stores holds true , then it would have an enormous impact on global warming predictions . Climate scientists have long known that plants offset some of the effects of climate change by absorbing and storing CO2 . But climate scientists assumed that the ability to plants to perform this function was limited because the availability of nitrogen in the atmosphere was limited . As a 2003 study published in the same Science journal put it , "" there will not be enough nitrogen available to sustain the high carbon uptake scenarios . "" In the wake of the latest findings , Ronald Amundson , a soil biogeochemist at the University of California at Berkeley , told Chemical and Engineering News that "" If there is more nitrogen there than expected , then the constraints on plant growth in a high - CO2 world may not be as great as we think . "" In other words , with more nitrogen available , plant life might be able to absorb more CO2 than climate scientists have been estimating , which means the planet wo n't warm as much , despite mankind 's pumping CO2 into the atmosphere . A Stunning Finding Houlton has been exploring this possibility for years . Back in 2011 , he reported that forest trees can tap into nitrogen found in rock . At the time , he said "" the stunning finding that forests can also feed on nitrogen in rocks has the potential to change all projections related to climate change , "" because it meant there could be more carbon storage on land and less in the atmosphere than climate models say . The question is whether any climate scientists or environmentalists — who are entirely wedded to the idea that industrialization is destroying the planet — would ever admit this . That 's why that word "" paradigm "" is important . As we 've noted in this space , the idea of "" settled science "" peddled by environmentalists and politicians defies the history of science , which has seen repeated upheavals of previous forms of "" settled science . "" Thomas Kuhn studied this phenomenon in his 1962 book "" The Structure Of Scientific Revolutions . "" He explained how scientists develop a theory — or paradigm — based on available evidence — to explain what they 're seeing . Once that paradigm takes hold , scientists are often loath to give up on it even if evidence piles up that it might be wrong . Eventually , however , faulty paradigms do give way , ushering in a new scientific paradigm . Examples of such paradigm shifts in the past : heliocentric solar system , continental drift , Einstein 's theories . A Coming Paradigm Shift ? That same thing might be happening right now with climate science . As we 've said many times , evidence continues to show weaknesses in climate models used to predict future warming . They failed to predict a decade - long pause in global temperatures . Nor have various calamities that were supposed to have occurred by now materialized . And a recent paper published in Nature concluded that the planet is less sensitive to increases in CO2 than the computer models say . Meanwhile , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been conducting highly suspicious temperature data manipulation . The changes in the temperature data consistently make the past seem cooler , which in turn makes the present seem warmer . This creates a data illusion of ever - rising temperatures to match the increase in CO2 in the Earth 's atmosphere . Marc Morano , editor of the popular ClimateDepot blog and author of "" The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change , "" notes that "" science is not supposed to have a politically predetermined outcome pushed by ideology and politics . This new nitrogen study is but one example of consensus science being overturned . The global warming science establishment should now be open to similar studies and dissenting voices on CO2 to overturn the alleged climate change consensus . "" But will they ? With their reputations and huge amounts government grant money at stake , it 's unlikely that many climate scientists would ever admit to being wrong . No matter how obvious it became that they were .","['Misleading', 'Derogatory', 'Flawed_reasoning']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/iflscience-story-on-speculative-report-provides-little-scientific-context-james-felton/,"A harrowing scenario analysis of how human civilization might collapse in coming decades due to climate change has been endorsed by a former Australian defense chief and senior royal navy commander . The analysis , published by the Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration , a think - tank in Melbourne , Australia , describes climate change as “ a near- to mid - term existential threat to human civilization ” and sets out a plausible scenario of where business - as - usual could lead over the next 30 years . The paper argues that the potentially “ extremely serious outcomes ” of climate - related security threats are often far more probable than conventionally assumed , but almost impossible to quantify because they “ fall outside the human experience of the last thousand years . ” On our current trajectory , the report warns , “ planetary and human systems [ are ] reaching a ‘ point of no return ’ by mid - century , in which the prospect of a largely uninhabitable Earth leads to the breakdown of nations and the international order . ” The only way to avoid the risks of this scenario is what the report describes as “ akin in scale to the World War II emergency mobilization”—but this time focused on rapidly building out a zero - emissions industrial system to set in train the restoration of a safe climate . The scenario warns that our current trajectory will likely lock in at least 3 degrees Celsius ( C ) of global heating , which in turn could trigger further amplifying feedbacks unleashing further warming . This would drive the accelerating collapse of key ecosystems “ including coral reef systems , the Amazon rainforest and in the Arctic . ” The results would be devastating . Some one billion people would be forced to attempt to relocate from unlivable conditions , and two billion would face scarcity of water supplies . Agriculture would collapse in the sub - tropics , and food production would suffer dramatically worldwide . The internal cohesion of nation - states like the US and China would unravel . “ Even for 2 ° C of warming , more than a billion people may need to be relocated and in high - end scenarios , the scale of destruction is beyond our capacity to model with a high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end , ” the report notes . The new policy briefing is written by David Spratt , Breakthrough ’s research director and Ian Dunlop , a former senior executive of Royal Dutch Shell who previously chaired the Australian Coal Association . In the briefing ’s foreword , retired Admiral Chris Barrie — Chief of the Australian Defence Force from 1998 to 2002 and former Deputy Chief of the Australian Navy — commends the paper for laying “ bare the unvarnished truth about the desperate situation humans , and our planet , are in , painting a disturbing picture of the real possibility that human life on Earth may be on the way to extinction , in the most horrible way . ” Barrie now works for the Climate Change Institute at Australian National University , Canberra . Spratt told Motherboard that a key reason the risks are not understood is that “ much knowledge produced for policymakers is too conservative . Because the risks are now existential , a new approach to climate and security risk assessment is required using scenario analysis . ” Last October , Motherboard reported on scientific evidence that the UN ’s summary report for government policymakers on climate change — whose findings were widely recognized as “ devastating”—were in fact too optimistic . While the Breakthrough scenario sets out some of the more ‘ high end ’ risk possibilities , it is often not possible to meaningfully quantify their probabilities . As a result , the authors emphasize that conventional risk approaches tend to downplay worst - case scenarios despite their plausibility . Spratt and Dunlop ’s 2050 scenario illustrates how easy it could be to end up in an accelerating runaway climate scenario which would lead to a largely uninhabitable planet within just a few decades . “ A high - end 2050 scenario finds a world in social breakdown and outright chaos , ” said Spratt . “ But a short window of opportunity exists for an emergency , global mobilization of resources , in which the logistical and planning experiences of the national security sector could play a valuable role .","['Alarmist', 'Misleading']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/betsy-mccaughey-wake-up-obama-climate-change-has-been-happening-forever/,"President Obama hiked to Exit Glacier in Alaska last week , with photographers in tow , to send the world a message : The glacier is melting . Obama blames it on the increasing use of fossil fuels such as coal , oil and natural gas , which he wants to restrict not only in the United States but worldwide . The photo op was designed to build support for an international climate agreement he ’s pushing hard to sell , so far with little success . Trouble is , the president needs to get his facts straight . Exit Glacier has been shrinking for 200 years — since 1815 — long before widespread industrialization and automobiles . As the president ended his trip , he sounded the alarm again : “ This state ’s climate is changing before our eyes . ” News flash , Mr. President : Alaska has been buffeted by cyclical swings in climate for thousands of years . That ’s true for the rest of the world , too . There was a 300 - year - long Medieval heat wave , followed by a Little Ice Age that began around 1300 , and then the 300 - year warming period we ’re in now . The Anchorage Daily Times ran a front - page story in 1922 recording the “ unheard - of temperatures ” in the Arctic and glaciers disappearing . “ The Arctic Ocean is warming up and icebergs are growing scarcer . ” Oblivious to the history of constant climate change , Obama pointed to Exit Glacier and said : “ We want to make sure our grandkids can see this . ” He may get his wish , but it wo n’t be because of anything he ’s doing . The current warming trend appears to be over , speculates Roger Cohen , a fellow of the American Physical Society . The Alaska Climate Research Center reports almost no evidence of warming trends in Alaska since 1977 . Many scientists are predicting the onset of two or three centuries of cooler weather — which would mean bigger glaciers . That ’s despite the world ’s growing use of fossil fuels . No matter what humans do , temperature trends go up , and then down ; glaciers expand and then recede ; sea levels rise and then fall , explains Will Happer , professor emeritus of physics at Princeton . That does n’t mean pollution controls are futile . We all want to breathe clean air . But do n’t blame climate change on humans . There are bigger forces at work here . Scientists disagree about what these forces are , and are researching better ways of accurately measuring temperature trends via satellite . Amid all this controversy and uncertainty about global climate change , Obama blindly insists that his theory of global warming “ is beyond dispute ” and attacks his critics as “ deniers . ” Sounding more like an Old Testament doomsayer than a president , Obama warned in his Alaska speech that unless carbon fuels are restricted , “ we will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair : Submerged countries . Abandoned cities . Fields no longer growing . ” Sounds scary , but he ’s on thin ice backing up those predictions . Despite Obama ’s professed concern for the people of Alaska affected by climate change , his visit was more about theatrics than helping locals . Alaska ’s Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski lambasted Obama ’s job - killing new restrictions on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic . Obama says the region ’s “ very fragile , ” but Murkowski is more worried that the economy is fragile . “ It ’s clear this administration does not care about us and sees us as nothing but a territory , ” she said . It ’s a demonstration of Obama ’s appalling lack of priorities . The president told his Alaska audience that “ few things will disrupt our lives as profoundly as climate change . ” Really , Mr. President ? How about the epidemic of cop shootings in the United States , or the drowned toddlers washing up on Mediterranean shores as families flee the Middle East , or ISIS beheading thousands of Christians ? Obama says that with climate change , more than any other issue , “ there is such a thing as being too late . ” Tell that to a cop ’s widow or the father who watched his family drown .","['Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Inaccurate']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/climate-change-emergency-jet-stream-shift-warning-global-warming-extreme-weather-gabriel-samuels-the-independent/,"Two environmentalists have declared a “ global climate emergency ” after the Northern hemisphere jet stream was found to have crossed the equator , bringing “ unprecedented ” changes to the world ’s weather patterns . Robert Scribbler and University of Ottawa researcher Paul Beckwith warned of the “ weather - destabilising and extreme weather - generating ” consequences of the jet stream shift . However other scientists dismissed their claims , with one describing their concern over wind crossing the equator as "" total nonsense "" . Scribbler and Beckwith said the anomalies were most likely precipitated by man - made climate change , which caused the jet stream to slow down and create larger waves . Scribbler wrote in a post on his environmental blog on Tuesday : “ It ’s the very picture of weather - weirding due to climate change . Something that would absolutely not happen in a normal world . Something , that if it continues , basically threatens seasonal integrity . The blogger explained the barrier between the two jet streams generates the strong divide between summer and winter , and the “ death of winter ” could commence if it is eroded as warm weather leaks into the “ winter zone ” of the year . He continued : “ As the poles have warmed due to human - forced climate change , the Hemispherical Jet Streams have moved out of the Middle Latitudes more and more . You get this weather - destabilising and extreme weather generating mixing of seasons . ” Meanwhile , Mr Beckwith confirmed the changes would usher in a sustained period of “ climate system mayhem ” which could prove difficult to resolve . He said : “ Our climate system behaviour continues to behave in new and scary ways that we have never anticipated , or seen before . “ Welcome to climate chaos . We must declare a global climate emergency . “ The behaviour of the jet stream suggests massive hits to the [ global ] food supply and the potential for massive geopolitical unrest . There ’s very strange things going on on planet Earth right now . ” There are two forms of jet streams - polar and subtropical - and the northern and southern hemispheres have one of each . The streams are the products of atmospheric heating by solar radiation and kept in place by the force of inertia .","['Alarmist', 'Misleading', 'Inaccurate']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-story-accurately-describes-study-on-environmental-impacts-of-our-food-system-damian-carrington/,"Huge reductions in meat - eating are essential to avoid dangerous climate change , according to the most comprehensive analysis yet of the food system ’s impact on the environment . In western countries , beef consumption needs to fall by 90 % and be replaced by five times more beans and pulses . The research also finds that enormous changes to farming are needed to avoid destroying the planet ’s ability to feed the 10 billion people expected to be on the planet in a few decades . Food production already causes great damage to the environment , via greenhouse gases from livestock , deforestation and water shortages from farming , and vast ocean dead zones from agricultural pollution . But without action , its impact will get far worse as the world population rises by 2.3 billion people by 2050 and global income triples , enabling more people to eat meat - rich western diets . This trajectory would smash critical environmental limits beyond which humanity will struggle to live , the new research indicates . “ It is pretty shocking , ” said Marco Springmann at the University of Oxford , who led the research team . “ We are really risking the sustainability of the whole system . If we are interested in people being able to farm and eat , then we better not do that . ” “ Feeding a world population of 10 billion is possible , but only if we change the way we eat and the way we produce food , ” said Prof Johan Rockström at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany , who was part of the research team . “ Greening the food sector or eating up our planet : this is what is on the menu today . ” The new study follows the publication of a landmark UN report on Monday in which the world ’s leading scientists warned there are just a dozen years in which to keep global warming under 1.5C , beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought , floods and extreme heat . The report said eating less meat and dairy was important but said current trends were in the opposite direction . The new research , published in the journal Nature , is the most thorough to date and combined data from every country to assess the impact of food production on the global environment . It then looked at what could be done to stop the looming food crisis . “ There is no magic bullet , ” said Springmann . “ But dietary and technological change [ on farms ] are the two essential things , and hopefully they can be complemented by reduction in food loss and waste . ” About a third of food produced today never reaches the table . The researchers found a global shift to a “ flexitarian ” diet was needed to keep climate change even under 2C , let alone 1.5C. This flexitarian diet means the average world citizen needs to eat 75 % less beef , 90 % less pork and half the number of eggs , while tripling consumption of beans and pulses and quadrupling nuts and seeds . This would halve emissions from livestock and better management of manure would enable further cuts . In rich nations , the dietary changes required are ever more stark . UK and US citizens need to cut beef by 90 % and milk by 60 % while increasing beans and pulses between four and six times . However , the millions of people in poor nations who are undernourished need to eat a little more meat and dairy . Reducing meat consumption might be achieved by a mix of education , taxes , subsidies for plant - based foods and changes to school and workplace menus , the scientists said . To halt deforestation , water shortages and pollution from overuse of fertiliser , profound changes in farming practices are needed . These include increasing crop yields in poorer nations , more universal water storage and far more careful use of fertilisers . “ I was surprised by the fact we need a combination of very ambitious options , ” Springmann said . “ We really need to push it to the edge of what is possible . ” All the diet and farming options are already being implemented in somewhere in the world , said Springmann . In the Netherlands and Israel , fertilisers and water are being better used , while big cuts in meat consumption are being seen among young people in some cities . But a global change is needed , he said : “ I think we can do it , but we really need much more proactive governments to provide the right framework . People can make a personal difference by changing their diet , but also by knocking on the doors of their politicians and saying we need better environmental regulations – that is also very important . Do not let politicians off the hook . ” Prof Tim Benton at the University of Leeds , who was not part of the research team , said : “ Ultimately , we live on a finite planet , with finite resources . It is a fiction to imagine there is a technological solution allowing us to produce as much food as we might ever want , allowing us to overeat and throw food away . ” He said the environmental burden of the current food system “ undermines the ability of future generations to live on a stable and ecologically rich planet ” . Prof Peter Smith at the University of Aberdeen , who was also not part of the research team , said : “ We know food choices are very personal , and that behaviour change can be difficult to encourage , but the evidence is now unequivocal – we need to change our diets if we are to have a sustainable future .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/financial-post-publishes-misleading-opinion-misrepresents-science-polar-bears-peril-susan-crockford/,"One powerful polar bear fact is slowly rising above the message of looming catastrophe repeated endlessly by the media : More than 15,000 polar bears have not disappeared since 2005 . Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050 , the predicted 67 - per - cent decline in polar bear numbers simply did n’t happen . Rather , global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved . The polar bear ’s resilience should have meant the end of its use as a cherished icon of global warming doom , but it did n’t . The alarmism is not going away without a struggle . Part of this struggle involves a scientific clash about transparency in polar bear science . My close examination of recent research has revealed that serious inconsistencies exist within the polar bear literature and between that literature and public statements made by some researchers . For example , Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart , depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet . But that fact , documented in more than a dozen scientific papers , is not discussed today as part of polar bear ecology . In these days of politicized science , neither Stirling nor his colleagues mention in public the devastating effects of thick spring ice in the Beaufort Sea ; instead , they imply in recent papers that the starving bears they witnessed are victims of reduced summer sea ice , which they argued depleted the bears ’ prey . There are also strong indications that thick spring - ice conditions happened again in 2014–16 , with the impacts on polar bears being similarly portrayed as effects of global warming . The polar bear 's resilience should have meant the end of its use as an icon of global warming doom One reason that the 2007 predictions of future polar bear survival were so far off base is that the model developed by American biologist Steven Amstrup ( now at Polar Bears International , an NGO ) assumed any polar bear population decline would be caused by less summer ice , despite the Beaufort Sea experience . Moreover , Amstrup and fellow modelers were overly confident in their claim that summer ice was critical for the polar bear ’s survival and they had little data on which to base their assumption that less summer ice would devastate the polar bears ’ prey . Consequently , many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals ( the primary prey of polar bears ) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open - water season , which is particularly conducive to fishing : These seals do most of their feeding in summer . More food for seals in summer means more fat seal pups for polar bears to eat the following spring , a result that ’s probably true throughout the Arctic . As long as polar bears have lots of baby seals to eat in spring , they get fat enough to survive even a longer - than - usual summer fast . And while it ’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s , there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice . Not all bears get enough to eat in the spring , of course . Starvation has always been the leading natural cause of death for polar bears , due to a number of factors including competition , injury , tooth decay and illness . Some cancers induce a muscle - wasting syndrome that leads to faster - than - usual weight loss . This is likely what happened to the emaciated Baffin Island bear captured on video in July 2017 and promoted by National Geographic late last year . The videographers claimed it showed what starvation due to sea - ice loss looked like — an implausible conclusion given the time of year , the isolated nature of the incident , and the fact that sea ice that year was no more reduced than previously . That starving - bear video may have convinced a few more gullible people that only hundreds of polar bears are left in the world . But it also motivated others to locate the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List report for 2015 that estimated global polar bear numbers at somewhere between 22,000 - 31,000 , or about 26,000 , up slightly from 20,000 - 25,000 , or about 22,500 , in 2005 . Newer counts not included in the 2015 assessment potentially add another 2,500 or so to the total . This increase may not be statistically significant , but it is decidedly not the 67 - per - cent decline that was predicted given the ice conditions that prevailed . The failure of the 2007 polar bear survival model is a simple fact that explodes the myth that polar bears are on their way to extinction . Although starving - bear videos and scientifically insignificant research papers still make the news , they do n’t alter the facts : Polar bears are thriving , making them phony icons , and false idols , for global warming alarmists .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/stunning-new-data-indicates-el-nino-drove-record-highs-global-temperatures-david-rose-daily-mail/,"Global average temperatures over land have plummeted by more than 1C since the middle of this year – their biggest and steepest fall on record . The news comes amid mounting evidence that the recent run of world record high temperatures is about to end . The fall , revealed by Nasa satellite measurements of the lower atmosphere , has been caused by the end of El Nino – the warming of surface waters in a vast area of the Pacific west of Central America . Global average temperatures over land have plummeted by more than 1C since the middle of this year – their biggest and steepest fall on record . The news comes amid mounting evidence that the recent run of world record high temperatures is about to end . The fall , revealed by Nasa satellite measurements of the lower atmosphere , has been caused by the end of El Nino – the warming of surface waters in a vast area of the Pacific west of Central America . Others have argued that the records were caused by El Nino , a complex natural phenomenon that takes place every few years , and has nothing to do with greenhouse gas emissions by humans . The new fall in temperatures suggests they were right . Big El Ninos always have an immense impact on world weather , triggering higher than normal temperatures over huge swathes of the world . The 2015 - 16 El Nino was probably the strongest since accurate measurements began , with the water up to 3C warmer than usual . It has now been replaced by a La Nina event – when the water in the same Pacific region turns colder than normal . This also has worldwide impacts , driving temperatures down rather than up . The satellite measurements over land respond quickly to El Nino and La Nina . Temperatures over the sea are also falling , but not as fast , because the sea retains heat for longer . This means it is possible that by some yardsticks , 2016 will be declared as hot as 2015 or even slightly hotter – because El Nino did not vanish until the middle of the year . But it is almost certain that next year , large falls will also be measured over the oceans , and by weather station thermometers on the surface of the planet – exactly as happened after the end of the last very strong El Nino in 1998 . If so , some experts will be forced to eat their words . Last year , Dr Schmidt said 2015 would have been a record hot year even without El Nino . ‘ The reason why this is such a warm record year is because of the long - term underlying trend , the cumulative effect of the long - term warming trend of our Earth , ’ he said . This was ‘ mainly caused ’ by the emission of greenhouse gases by humans . Dr Schmidt also denied that there was any ‘ pause ’ or ‘ hiatus ’ in global warming between the 1998 and 2015 El Ninos . But on its website home page yesterday , Nasa featured a new study which said there was a hiatus in global warming before the recent El Nino , and discussed why this was so . Last night Dr Schmidt had not returned a request for comment . However , both his own position , and his Nasa division , may be in jeopardy . US President - elect Donald Trump is an avowed climate change sceptic , who once claimed it was a hoax invented by China . Last week , Mr Trump ’s science adviser Bob Walker said he was likely to axe Nasa ’s $ 1.9 billion ( about £ 1.4 billion ) climate research budget . Other experts have also disputed Dr Schmidt ’s claims . Professor Judith Curry , of the Georgia Institute of Technology , and president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network , said yesterday : ‘ I disagree with Gavin . The record warm years of 2015 and 2016 were primarily caused by the super El Nino . ’ The slowdown in warming was , she added , real , and all the evidence suggested that since 1998 , the rate of global warming has been much slower than predicted by computer models – about 1C per century . David Whitehouse , a scientist who works with Lord Lawson ’s sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation , said the massive fall in temperatures following the end of El Nino meant the warming hiatus or slowdown may be coming back . ‘ According to the satellites , the late 2016 temperatures are returning to the levels they were at after the 1998 El Nino . The data clearly shows El Nino for what it was – a short - term weather event , ’ he said .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Inaccurate']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/financial-post-commentary-misleads-warming-effect-greenhouse-gas-emissions-cherry-picking-studies-ross-mckitrick/,"One of the most important numbers in the world goes by the catchy title of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity , or ECS . It is a measure of how much the climate responds to greenhouse gases . More formally , it is defined as the increase , in degrees Celsius , of average temperatures around the world , after doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and allowing the atmosphere and the oceans to adjust fully to the change . The reason it ’s important is that it is the ultimate justification for governmental policies to fight climate change . The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) says ECS is likely between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius , but it ca n’t be more precise than that . Which is too bad , because an enormous amount of public policy depends on its value . People who study the impacts of global warming have found that if ECS is low — say , less than two — then the impacts of global warming on the economy will be mostly small and , in many places , mildly beneficial . If it is very low , for instance around one , it means greenhouse gas emissions are simply not worth doing anything about . But if ECS is high — say , around four degrees or more — then climate change is probably a big problem . We may not be able to stop it , but we ’d better get ready to adapt to it . So , somebody , somewhere , ought to measure ECS . As it turns out , a lot of people have been trying , and what they have found has enormous policy implications . To understand why , we first need to delve into the methodology a bit . There are two ways scientists try to estimate ECS . The first is to use a climate model , double the modeled CO2 concentration from the pre - industrial level , and let it run until temperatures stabilize a few hundred years into the future . This approach , called the model - based method , depends for its accuracy on the validity of the climate model , and since models differ quite a bit from one another , it yields a wide range of possible answers . A well - known statistical distribution derived from modeling studies summarizes the uncertainties in this method . It shows that ECS is probably between two and 4.5 degrees , possibly as low as 1.5 but not lower , and possibly as high as nine degrees . This range of potential warming is very influential on economic analyses of the costs of climate change . The second method is to use long - term historical data on temperatures , solar activity , carbon - dioxide emissions and atmospheric chemistry to estimate ECS using a simple statistical model derived by applying the law of conservation of energy to the planetary atmosphere . This is called the Energy Balance method . It relies on some extrapolation to satisfy the definition of ECS but has the advantage of taking account of the available data showing how the actual atmosphere has behaved over the past 150 years . The surprising thing is that the Energy Balance estimates are very low compared to model - based estimates . The accompanying chart compares the model - based range to ECS estimates from a dozen Energy Balance studies over the past decade . Clearly these two methods give differing answers , and the question of which one is more accurate is important . Climate modelers have put forward two explanations for the discrepancy . One is called the “ emergent constraint ” approach . The idea is that models yield a range of ECS values , and while we ca n’t measure ECS directly , the models also yield estimates of a lot of other things that we can measure ( such as the reflectivity of cloud tops ) , so we could compare those other measures to the data , and when we do , sometimes the models with high ECS values also yield measures of secondary things that fit the data better than models with low ECS values . This argument has been a bit of a tough sell , since the correlations involved are often weak , and it does n’t explain why the Energy Balance results are so low . The second approach is based on so - called “ forcing efficacies , ” which is the concept that climate forcings , such as greenhouse gases and aerosol pollutants , differ in their effectiveness over time and space , and if these variations are taken into account the Energy Balance sensitivity estimates may come out higher . This , too , has been a controversial suggestion . A recent Energy Balance ECS estimate was just published in the Journal of Climate by Nicholas Lewis and Judith Curry . There are several features that make their study especially valuable . First , they rely on IPCC estimates of greenhouse gases , solar changes and other climate forcings , so they ca n’t be accused of putting a finger on the scale by their choice of data . Second , they take into account the efficacy issue and discuss it at length . They also take into account recent debates about how surface temperatures should or should n’t be measured , and how to deal with areas like the Arctic where data are sparse . Third , they compute their estimates over a variety of start and end dates to check that their ECS estimate is not dependent on the relative warming hiatus of the past two decades . It looks like the climate models we have been using for decades need to be revised Their ECS estimate is 1.5 degrees , with a probability range between 1.05 and 2.45 degrees . If the study was a one - time outlier we might be able to ignore it .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/patrick-michaels-the-climate-snow-job-the-wall-street-journal/,"An East Coast blizzard howling , global temperatures peaking , the desert Southwest flooding , drought - stricken California drying up — surely there ’s a common thread tying together this “ extreme ” weather . There is . But it has little to do with what recent headlines have been saying about the hottest year ever . It is called business as usual . Surface temperatures are indeed increasing slightly : They ’ve been going up , in fits and starts , for more than 150 years , or since a miserably cold and pestilential period known as the Little Ice Age . Before carbon dioxide from economic activity could have warmed us up , temperatures rose three - quarters of a degree Fahrenheit between 1910 and World War II . They then cooled down a bit , only to warm again from the mid-1970s to the late ’ 90s , about the same amount as earlier in the century . Whether temperatures have warmed much since then depends on what you look at . Until last June , most scientists acknowledged that warming reached a peak in the late 1990s , and since then had plateaued in a “ hiatus . ” There are about 60 different explanations for this in the refereed literature . That changed last summer , when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) decided to overhaul its data , throwing out satellite - sensed sea - surface temperatures since the late 1970s and instead relying on , among other sources , readings taken from the cooling - water - intake tubes of oceangoing vessels . The scientific literature is replete with articles about the large measurement errors that accrue in this data owing to the fact that a ship ’s infrastructure conducts heat , absorbs a tremendous amount of the sun ’s energy , and vessels ’ intake tubes are at different ocean depths . See , for instance , John J. Kennedy ’s “ A review of uncertainty in in situ measurements and data sets of sea surface temperature , ” published Jan. 24 , 2014 , by the journal Reviews of Geophysics . NOAA ’s alteration of its measurement standard and other changes produced a result that could have been predicted : a marginally significant warming trend in the data over the past several years , erasing the temperature plateau that vexed climate alarmists have found difficult to explain . Yet the increase remains far below what had been expected .","['Inaccurate', 'Misleading', 'Cherry-picking', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Biased']"

One meteorologist described the loss of ice as “ scary ” . Others said it could force scientists to revise their theories about which part of the Arctic will withstand warming the longest . The sea off the north coast of Greenland is normally so frozen that it was referred to , until recently , as “ the last ice area ” because it was assumed that this would be the final northern holdout against the melting effects of a hotter planet . But abnormal temperature spikes in February and earlier this month have left it vulnerable to winds , which have pushed the ice further away from the coast than at any time since satellite records began in the 1970s . “ Almost all of the ice to the north of Greenland is quite shattered and broken up and therefore more mobile , ” said Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute . “ Open water off the north coast of Greenland is unusual . This area has often been called ‘ the last ice area ’ as it has been suggested that the last perennial sea ice in the Arctic will occur here . The events of the last week suggest that , actually , the last ice area may be further west . ” Ice to the north of Greenland is usually particularly compacted due to the Transpolar Drift Stream , one of two major weather patterns that push ice from Siberia across the Arctic to the coastline , where it packs . Walt Meier , a senior research scientist at the US National Snow and Ice Data Center , said : “ The ice there has nowhere else to go so it piles up . On average , it ’s over four metres thick and can be piled up into ridges 20 metres thick or more . This thick , compacted ice is generally not easily moved around . “ However , that was not the case this past winter ( in February and March ) and now . The ice is being pushed away from the coast by the winds . ” Ice is easier to blow around as a result of a warming trend , which has accelerated over the past 15 years . “ The thinning is reaching even the coldest part of the Arctic with the thickest ice . So it ’s a pretty dramatic indication of the transformation of the Arctic sea ice and Arctic climate . ” “ Scary , ” wrote Thomas Lavergne , a scientist at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute , in a retweet of a satellite - gif of the blue water penetrating white ice and exposing hundreds of miles of the Greenland coastline . He said this would flush chunks of thicker ice out through the Fram or Nares Straits into warmer southern waters . “ I can not tell how long this open water patch will remain open , but even if it closes in few days from now , the harm will be done : the thick old sea ice will have been pushed away from the coast , to an area where it will melt more easily , ” he added . This year ’s openings are driven more by wind than melting but they have occurred during two temperature spikes . In February , the Kap Morris Jesup weather station in the region is usually below -20C , but earlier this year there were 10 days above freezing and warm winds , which unlocked the ice from the coast . Last week , the crack opened again after Kap Morris Jesup briefly registered a record high of 17C and strong southerly winds picked up to 11 knots . Experts predict that coastal seas will freeze again but probably later than normal . “ I think that solar heating of the water column will increase during this opening and this will delay freeze - up and ice formation , ” said Rasmus Tage Tonboe , a sea ice expert at the the Danish Meteorological Institute . The latest readings by the Norwegian Ice Service show that Arctic ice cover in the Svalbard area this week is 40 % below the average for this time of year since 1981 . In the past month , at least 14 days in the past month have hit record lows in this region . Although thinner ice elsewhere in the Arctic means this is unlikely to be a record low year overall , they are in line with predictions that there will be no summer ice in the Arctic Ocean at some point between 2030 and 2050 . Keld Qvistgaard , the ice service coordinator in Denmark , said this was not the first time a gap had appeared between the shore and the main ice pack but the one formed from 1 to 5 August was different in its extent . “ This event is a pretty big one going all the way to west of Kap Morris Jesup . This is unusual , ” he said . As well as reducing ice cover , the ocean intrusion raises concerns of feedbacks , which could tip the Earth towards a hothouse state . Freakish Arctic temperatures have alarmed climate scientists since the beginning of the year . During the sunless winter , a heatwave raised concerns that the polar vortex may be eroding . This includes the Gulf Stream , which is at its weakest level in 1,600 years due to melting Greenland ice and ocean warming . With lower circulation of water and air , weather systems tend to linger longer .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-post-article-accurately-describes-latest-estimate-accelerating-antarctic-ice-loss-chris-mooney/,"Antarctica ’s ice sheet is melting at a rapidly increasing rate , now pouring more than 200 billion tons of ice into the ocean annually and raising sea levels a half - millimeter every year , a team of 80 scientists reported Wednesday . The melt rate has tripled in the past decade , the study concluded . If the acceleration continues , some of scientists ’ worst fears about rising oceans could be realized , leaving low - lying cities and communities with less time to prepare than they had hoped . The result also reinforces that nations have a short window — perhaps no more than a decade — to cut greenhouse - gas emissions if they hope to avert some of the worst consequences of climate change . Antarctica , the planet ’s largest ice sheet , lost 219 billion tons of ice annually from 2012 through 2017 — approximately triple the 73 billion - ton melt rate of a decade ago , the scientists concluded . From 1992 through 1997 , Antarctica lost 49 billion tons of ice annually . The study is the product of a large group of Antarctic experts who collectively reviewed 24 recent measurements of Antarctic ice loss , reconciling their differences to produce the most definitive figures yet on changes in Antarctica . Their results — known formally as the “ Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter - Comparison Exercise ” ( IMBIE ) — were published Wednesday in the journal Nature . “ We took all the estimates across all the different techniques , and we got this consensus , ” said Isabella Velicogna , an Antarctic expert at the University of California at Irvine and one of the many authors from institutions in 14 countries . The lead authors was Andrew Shepherd of the University of Leeds in England and Erik Ivins of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory . “ The detailed record shows an acceleration , starting around 2002 , ” Beata Csatho , one of the study authors and a glaciologist at the University at Buffalo , said in an email . Csatho noted that comparing the first and last five - year periods in the record reveals an even steeper acceleration . “ Actually , if you compare 1997 - 2002 to 2012 - 2017 , the increase is even larger , a factor of more than 5 ! ! ” she wrote . For the total period from 1992 through the present , the ice sheet has lost nearly 3 trillion tons of ice , equating to just less than 8 millimeters of sea - level rise . Forty percent of that loss has occurred in the past five years . The rapid , recent changes are almost entirely driven by the West Antarctic ice sheet , which scientists have long viewed as an Achilles ’ heel . It is known to be losing ice rapidly because it is being melted from below by warm ocean waters , a process that is rendering its largest glaciers unstable . West Antarctica lost 159 billion tons of ice a year from 2012 through 2017 , compared with 65 billion tons from 2002 through 2007 . The growth is largely attributable to just two huge glaciers : Pine Island and Thwaites . The latter is increasingly being viewed as posing a potential planetary emergency because of its enormous size and its role as a gateway that could allow the ocean to someday access the entirety of West Antarctica , turning the marine - based ice sheet into a new sea . Pine Island is now losing about 45 billion tons per year , and Thwaites is losing 50 billion . Both numbers are higher than the annual losses for any other glacier in the world . “ The increasing mass loss that they ’re finding is really worrying , particularly looking at the West Antarctic , the area that ’s changing most rapidly , ” said Christine Dow , a glaciologist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario who was not involved in the research . “ And it ’s the area that we ’re most worried about , because it ’s below sea level . ” “ If you start removing mass from there , you can have a very large - scale evacuation of ice into the ocean and significant sea - level rise , ” Dow said . Dow is the lead author of a just - published study outlining one process that could be driving , and could worsen , some of Antarctica ’s ice losses . She and her co - authors found that at numerous major glaciers including Pine Island , warm ocean waters are helping to carve out deep crevasses underneath the floating ice shelves that brace these glaciers in place . The shelves then tend to crack at these thinned - out points and break off large pieces , weakening their ability to hold back the flow of glacial ice into the ocean . “ Anywhere you have thinner ice , it ’s going to be weaker , ” Dow said . In addition to West Antarctica , another increase in ice losses in the past decade came from the smaller glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula , which are also melting rapidly but contain less potential to raise the sea level . The largest part of the continent , East Antarctica , has remained more stable and did not contribute much melt to the ocean during the period of study , the assessment says . However , in the past five years , it too has begun to lose ice , perhaps as much as 28 billion tons per year , although the uncertainty surrounding this number remains high . What ’s happening in East Antarctica is important because it has , by far , the most ice to give , being capable of raising sea levels by well over 100 feet . A single East Antarctic glacier , Totten , has the potential to unleash as much total sea - level rise as the entire West Antarctic ice sheet , or more .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/global-warming-fire-suppression-practices-boost-wildfires-us-west-correctly-reported-the-atlantic-robinson-meyer/,"This was n’t supposed to be a bad year for Western wildfires . Last winter , a weak La Niña bloomed across the Pacific . It sent flume after flume of rain to North America and irrigated half the continent . Water penetrated deep into the soil of Western forests , and mammoth snowdrifts stacked up across the Sierra Nevadas . California ’s drought ended in the washout . Yet fires are now raging across the West . More than two dozen named fires currently burn across Washington and Oregon . More than one million acres have burned in Montana , an area larger than Rhode Island , in the Treasure State ’s third - worst fire season on record . And the largest brushfire in the history of Los Angeles currently threatens hundreds of homes in Burbank . Canada may be experiencing an even worse year for wildfires : 2.86 million acres have burned in British Columbia , the largest area ever recorded in the province . So what happened ? How did a wet Western winter lead to a sky - choking summer ? The answer lies in the summer ’s record - breaking heat , say wildfire experts . Days of near-100 - degree - Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West in early July , and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in early August . “ This will become an important year for [ anecdotes about ] the importance of temperature . Despite the fact that these forests were really soaked down this winter and spring , these heat waves have dried things out enough to promote really large fires , ” says Park Williams , a research scientist at the Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University . “ This heat wave is having a way worse influence on fire than it would in absence of human - caused warming . ” In other words , the weeks of heat that baked the West in July and August were enough to wipe away some of the fire - dampening effect of the winter storms . “ The last 60 to 90 days have been exceptionally warm and dry , the perfect recipe for drying out fuels ( the one ingredient besides ignitions you need for fire in these systems ) , ” said John Abatzoglou , a professor of geography at the University of Idaho , in an email . “ I was running a few numbers this morning , and the last 60 days have been record warm from Spokane , Washington , to Medford , Oregon ; both Seattle and Missoula earlier this summer set records for the longest number of days without measurable rain . ” This excessive heat can have an outsize effect on the size of forest fires . For more than three decades , wildfire researchers have known that fire and aridity , which is controlled by heat , exist in an exponential relationship . Every degree of warming does more to promote fire than the previous degree of warming , Williams said . “ Now , thinking about temperature trends due to human - caused climate change , we think that the western United States is 1.5 [ degrees ] Celsius , or 3 degrees Fahrenheit , hotter than it would be in absence of climate change . And there ’s a heat wave on top of that , ” said Williams . “ Because of the exponential influence of temperature , that means that this heat wave is having a way worse influence on fire than it would in absence of human - caused warming . ” In the runaway consequences of each additional degree of warming , wildfires are a “ canary in the coal mine ” for the effects of climate change , Williams said . And global warming is already having an effect on wildfire . In a paper published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Williams and Abatzoglou found that the total area burned in the western United States over the past 33 years was double the size it would have been without any human - caused warming . “ The added forest fire area — due to just the degree and a half Celsius of warming — equaled the area of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined , ” Williams told me . The area of annual burned forest in the Pacific Northwest has increased by nearly 5000 percent . Other researchers have arrived at similar conclusions . A paper published in Science last year found that “ large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s , with higher large - wildfire frequency , longer wildfire durations , and longer wildfire seasons . ” The mid-1980s is also when most scientists argue that the effects of global warming began to be broadly felt . The same team of researchers also found that the area of annual burned forest in the Pacific Northwest has increased by nearly 5000 percent since the early 1970s . Fires have not only been increasing in size due to climate change . In the early 20th century , state and federal governments began aggressively fighting wildfires and trying to keep them as small as possible . This has caused denser and more fire - prone forests than the long - term average for the West , which has led to more massive and uncontrollable fires . People have also lengthened the season by starting fires — through errant fireworks , unattended campfires , or arson — earlier in the spring and later in the fall . In a human - free environment , fires could only start after a lightning strike , which only follow from summertime thunderstorms . “ Since the 1980s , we ’ve only burnt about 10 percent of the western U.S. forests . And that number to me means that there ’s still a whole lot more to burn , ” Williams said . He estimated that it would take another several decades for that excess century of fuel to burn out of the American woods . And in the meantime , the planet will only get hotter .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-potential-future-hothouse-climate-generally-accurate-but-misstates-details-jonathan-watts/,"A domino - like cascade of melting ice , warming seas , shifting currents and dying forests could tilt the Earth into a “ hothouse ” state beyond which human efforts to reduce emissions will be increasingly futile , a group of leading climate scientists has warned . This grim prospect is sketched out in a journal paper that considers the combined consequences of 10 climate change processes , including the release of methane trapped in Siberian permafrost and the impact of melting ice in Greenland on the Antarctic . The authors of the essay , published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , stress their analysis is not conclusive , but warn the Paris commitment to keep warming at 2C above pre - industrial levels may not be enough to “ park ” the planet ’s climate at a stable temperature . They warn that the hothouse trajectory “ would almost certainly flood deltaic environments , increase the risk of damage from coastal storms , and eliminate coral reefs ( and all of the benefits that they provide for societies ) by the end of this century or earlier . ” “ I do hope we are wrong , but as scientists we have a responsibility to explore whether this is real , ” said Johan Rockström , executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre . “ We need to know now . It ’s so urgent . This is one of the most existential questions in science . ” Advertisement Rockström and his co - authors are among the world ’s leading authorities on positive feedback loops , by which warming temperatures release new sources of greenhouse gases or destroy the Earth ’s ability to absorb carbon or reflect heat . Their new paper asks whether the planet ’s temperature can stabilise at 2C or whether it will gravitate towards a more extreme state . The authors attempt to assess whether warming can be halted or whether it will tip towards a “ hothouse ” world that is 4C warmer than pre - industrial times and far less supportive of human life . Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen , one of the authors , said the paper showed that climate action was not just a case of turning the knob on emissions , but of understanding how various factors interact at a global level . “ We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi - stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system , itself , will ‘ want ’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions , ” she said . “ This implies not only reducing emissions but much more . ” New feedback loops are still being discovered . A separate paper published in PNAS reveals that increased rainfall – a symptom of climate change in some regions - is making it harder for forest soils to trap greenhouse gases such as methane . Previous studies have shown that weakening carbon sinks will add 0.25C , forest dieback will add 0.11C , permafrost thaw will add 0.9C and increased bacterial respiration will add 0.02C. The authors of the new paper also look at the loss of methane hydrates from the ocean floor and the reduction of snow and ice cover at the poles . Rockström says there are huge gaps in data and knowledge about how one process might amplify another . Contrary to the Gaia theory , which suggests the Earth has a self - righting tendency , he says the feedbacks could push the planet to a more extreme state . As an example , the authors say the loss of Greenland ice could disrupt the Gulf Stream ocean current , which would raise sea levels and accumulate heat in the Southern Ocean , which would in turn accelerate ice loss from the east Antarctic . Concerns about this possibility were heightened earlier this year by reports that the Gulf Stream was at its weakest level in 1,600 years . Currently , global average temperatures are just over 1C above pre - industrial levels and rising at 0.17C per decade . The Paris climate agreement set actions to keep warming limited to 1.5C-2C by the end of the century , but the authors warn more drastic action may be necessary . “ The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming , ” Rockström said . “ Several positive feedback loops are already in operation , but they are still weak . We need studies to show when they might cause a runaway effect . Another climate scientist – who was not involved in the paper – emphasised the document aimed to raise questions rather than prove a theory . “ It ’s rather selective , but not outlandish , ” said Prof Martin Siegert , co - director of the Grantham Institute . “ Threshold and tipping points have been discussed previously , but to state that 2C is a threshold we ca n’t pull back from is new , I think . I ’m not sure what ‘ evidence ’ there is for this – or indeed whether there can be until we experience it . ” Rockström said the question needed asking . “ We could end up delivering the Paris agreement and keep to 2C of warming , but then face an ugly surprise if the system starts to slip away , ” he said . “ We do n’t say this will definitely happen . We just list all the disruptive events and come up with plausible occurrences … 50 years ago , this would be dismissed as alarmist , but now scientists have become really worried . ” “ In the context of the summer of 2018 , this is definitely not a case of crying wolf , raising a false alarm : the wolves are now in sight , ” said Dr Phil Williamson , a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-straightforward-answers-common-climate-questions-accurate-justin-gillis/,"Part 1 . What is happening ? 1 . Climate change ? Global warming ? What do we call it ? Both are accurate , but they mean different things . You can think of global warming as one type of climate change . The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures , such as shifting rainfall patterns . President Trump has claimed that scientists stopped referring to global warming and started calling it climate change because “ the weather has been so cold ” in winter . But the claim is false . Scientists have used both terms for decades . 2 . How much is the Earth heating up ? Two degrees is more significant than it sounds . As of early 2017 , the Earth had warmed by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit ( more than 1 degree Celsius ) since 1880 , when records began at a global scale . The number may sound low , but as an average over the surface of an entire planet , it is actually high , which explains why much of the world ’s land ice is starting to melt and the oceans are rising at an accelerating pace . If greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked , scientists say , the global warming could ultimately exceed 8 degrees Fahrenheit , which would undermine the planet ’s capacity to support a large human population . 3 . What is the greenhouse effect , and how does it cause global warming ? We ’ve known about it for more than a century . Really . In the 19th century , scientists discovered that certain gases in the air trap and slow down heat that would otherwise escape to space . Carbon dioxide is a major player ; without any of it in the air , the Earth would be a frozen wasteland . The first prediction that the planet would warm as humans released more of the gas was made in 1896 . The gas has increased 43 percent above the pre - industrial level so far , and the Earth has warmed by roughly the amount that scientists predicted it would . Interested in keeping up with climate change ? Sign up to receive our in - depth journalism about climate change around the world . 4 . How do we know humans are responsible for the increase in carbon dioxide ? This one is nailed down . Hard evidence , including studies that use radioactivity to distinguish industrial emissions from natural emissions , shows that the extra gas is coming from human activity . Carbon dioxide levels rose and fell naturally in the long - ago past , but those changes took thousands of years . Geologists say that humans are now pumping the gas into the air much faster than nature has ever done . 5 . Could natural factors be the cause of the warming ? Nope . In theory , they could be . If the sun were to start putting out more radiation , for instance , that would definitely warm the Earth . But scientists have looked carefully at the natural factors known to influence planetary temperature and found that they are not changing nearly enough . The warming is extremely rapid on the geologic time scale , and no other factor can explain it as well as human emissions of greenhouse gases . 6 . Why do people deny the science of climate change ? Mostly because of ideology . Instead of negotiating over climate change policies and trying to make them more market - oriented , some political conservatives have taken the approach of blocking them by trying to undermine the science . President Trump has sometimes claimed that scientists are engaged in a worldwide hoax to fool the public , or that global warming was invented by China to disable American industry . The climate denialists ’ arguments have become so strained that even oil and coal companies have distanced themselves publicly , though some still help to finance the campaigns of politicians who espouse such views . Part 2 . What could happen ? 1 . How much trouble are we in ? Big trouble . Over the coming 25 or 30 years , scientists say , the climate is likely to gradually warm , with more extreme weather . Coral reefs and other sensitive habitats are already starting to die . Longer term , if emissions rise unchecked , scientists fear climate effects so severe that they might destabilize governments , produce waves of refugees , precipitate the sixth mass extinction of plants and animals in the Earth ’s history , and melt the polar ice caps , causing the seas to rise high enough to flood most of the world ’s coastal cities . The emissions that create those risks are happening now , raising deep moral questions for our generation . 2 . How much should I worry about climate change affecting me directly ? Are you rich enough to shield your descendants ? The simple reality is that people are already feeling the effects , whether they know it or not . Because of sea level rise , for instance , some 83,000 more residents of New York and New Jersey were flooded during Hurricane Sandy than would have been the case in a stable climate , scientists have calculated . Tens of thousands of people are already dying in heat waves made worse by global warming . The refugee flows that have destabilized politics around the world have been traced in part to climate change . Of course , as with almost all other social problems , poor people will be hit first and hardest . 3 . How much will the seas rise ? The real question is how fast . The ocean has accelerated and is now rising at a rate of about a foot per century , forcing governments and property owners to spend tens of billions of dollars fighting coastal erosion . But if that rate continued , it would probably be manageable , experts say .",['Sound_reasoning']

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/article-in-the-sun-misrepresents-antarctic-discovery-and-misplaces-it-on-map-charlotte-edwards/,"CLIMATE change in Antarctica may be linked to a never - before - seen island emerging from the ocean , experts have said . The uncharted island is actually big enough to spot from space but may have gone unnoticed due to previously being hidden beneath a lot of ice , a Nature report suggests . Rising temperatures in Antarctica over the past decades have been linked to glacial retreat , which is a possible trigger for this island 's appearance . Extreme melting and changes to the climate may have released pressure on to the continent , allowing the ground to rise up , a Nature report claims . "" As glaciers have retreated in West Antarctica , they have released pressure on Earth ’s crust , allowing it to rebound and rise , "" said Lindsay Prothro , a glacial geologist at Texas A&M University – Corpus Christi . Rebounding ground can accelerate the ice cracking and falling away , which may be what happened with this new island that potentially emerged off the coast of Antarctica around 2010 . The island has been named after Sif , the Norse goddess of Earth and wife of Thor . It was first spotted by members of the Thwaites Offshore Research ( THOR ) project as their research vessel passed through Pine Island Bay . This bay is where ice flows into from the Pine Island Glacier , one of the fastest - retreating glaciers in Antarctica . According to Nature News , experts are n't sure how long the island has been visible but they think climate change may be behind its appearance . University of Houston marine geologist Julia Wellner was one of the investigators on the expedition that spotted the island . She tweeted : "" After being the first visitors , we can now confirm that Sif Island is made of granite and that it is covered by remnant ice shelf , and a few seals . "" The expedition crew has taken geological samples of the island , which could help to explain the way the continent is shifting . We 've contacted them to ask more details about the size of the Sif . Extreme melting events in Antarctica have recently revealed more of existing islands . Nasa recently released a image of Eagle Island losing 20 % of its snow cover in only 9 days at the start of this month .

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/ocean-acidification-yet-another-wobbly-pillar-climate-alarmism-james-delingpole-the-spectator/,"There was a breathtakingly beautiful BBC series on the Great Barrier Reef recently which my son pronounced himself almost too depressed to watch . ‘ What ’s the point ? ’ said Boy . ‘ By the time I get to Australia to see it the whole bloody lot will have dissolved . ’ The menace Boy was describing is ‘ ocean acidification ’ . It ’s no wonder he should find it worrying , for it has been assiduously promoted by environmentalists for more than a decade now as ‘ global warming ’s evil twin ’ . Last year , no fewer than 600 academic papers were published on the subject , so it must be serious , right ? First referenced in a peer - reviewed study in Nature in 2003 , it has since been endorsed by scientists from numerous learned institutions including the Royal Society , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the IPCC . Even the great David Attenborough — presenter of the Great Barrier Reef series — has vouched for its authenticity : ‘ If the temperature rises up by two degrees and the acidity by a measurable amount , lots of species of coral will die out . Quite what happens then is anybody ’s guess . But it wo n’t be good . ’ No indeed . Ocean acidification is the terrifying threat whereby all that man - made CO2 we ’ve been pumping into the atmosphere may react with the sea to form a sort of giant acid bath . First it will kill off all the calcified marine life , such as shellfish , corals and plankton . Then it will destroy all the species that depend on it — causing an almighty mass extinction which will wipe out the fishing industry and turn our oceans into a barren zone of death . Or so runs the scaremongering theory . The reality may be rather more prosaic . Ocean acidification — the evidence increasingly suggests — is a trivial , misleadingly named , and not remotely worrying phenomenon which has been hyped up beyond all measure for political , ideological and financial reasons . Some of us have suspected this for some time . According to Patrick Moore , a co - founder of Greenpeace , long one of ocean acidification theory ’s fiercest critics , the term is ‘ just short of propaganda ’ . The pH of the world ’s oceans ranges between 7.5 and 8.3 — well above the acid zone ( which starts below ‘ neutral ’ pH7 ) — so more correctly it should be stated that the seas are becoming slightly less alkaline . ‘ Acid ’ was chosen , Moore believes , because it has ‘ strong negative connotations for most people ’ . Matt Ridley , too , has been scathing on the topic . In The Rational Optimist he wrote , ‘ Ocean acidification looks suspiciously like a back - up plan by the environmental pressure groups in case the climate fails to warm . ’ I agree . That ’s why I like to call it the alarmists ’ Siegfried Line — their last redoubt should it prove , as looks increasingly to be the case , that the man - made global warming theory is a busted flush . To the alarmist camp , of course , this is yet further evidence that ‘ deniers ’ are heartless , anti - scientific conspiracy theorists who do n’t read peer - reviewed papers and could n’t give a toss if the world ’s marine life is dissolved in a pool of acid due to man ’s selfishness and greed . Unfortunately for the doom - mongers , we sceptics have just received some heavy fire - support from a neutral authority . Howard Browman , a marine scientist for 35 years , has published a review in the ICES Journal of Marine Science of all the papers published on the subject . His verdict could hardly be more damning . The methodology used by the studies was often flawed ; contrary studies suggesting that ocean acidification was n’t a threat had sometimes had difficulty finding a publisher . There was , he said , an ‘ inherent bias ’ in scientific journals which predisposed them to publish ‘ doom and gloom stories ’ . Ocean acidification theory appears to have been fatally flawed almost from the start . In 2004 , two NOAA scientists , Richard Feely and Christopher Sabine , produced a chart showing a strong correlation between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and falling oceanic pH levels . But then , just over a year ago , Mike Wallace , a hydrologist with 30 years ’ experience , noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information . Their chart only started in 1988 but , as Wallace knew , there were records dating back to at least 100 years before . So why had they ignored the real - world evidence in favour of computer - modelled projections ? When Wallace plotted a chart of his own , incorporating all the available data , covering the period from 1910 to the present , his results were surprising : there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last -century . Even if the oceans were ‘ acidifying ’ , though , it would n’t be a disaster for a number of reasons — as recently outlined in a paper by Patrick Moore for the Frontier Centre for Public Policy . First , marine species that calcify have survived through millions of years when CO2 was at much higher levels ; second , they are more than capable of adapting — even in the short term — to environmental change ; third , seawater has a large buffering capacity which prevents dramatic shifts in pH ; fourth , if oceans do become warmer due to ‘ climate change ’ , the effect will be for them to ‘ outgas ’ CO2 , not absorb more of it . Finally , and perhaps most damningly , Moore quotes a killer analysis conducted by Craig Idso of all the studies which have been done on the effects of reduced pH levels on marine life .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Inaccurate', 'Biased']"

The peer - reviewed study by two scientists and a veteran statistician looked at the global average temperature datasets ( GAST ) which are used by climate alarmists to argue that recent years have been “ the hottest evah ” and that the warming of the last 120 years has been dramatic and unprecedented . What they found is that these readings are “ totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data . ” That is , the adjusted data used by alarmist organizations like NASA , NOAA , and the UK Met Office differs so markedly from the original raw data that it can not be trusted . This chart gives you a good idea of the direction of the adjustments . The blue bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted downwards to make it cooler ; the red bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted upwards to make it warmer . Note how most of the downward adjustments take place in the early twentieth century and most of the upward take place in the late twentieth century . According to meteorologist Joe D’Aleo , who co - authored the study with statistician James Wallace and Cato Institute climate scientist Craig Idso , this has the effect of exaggerating the warming trend : “ Nearly all of the warming they are now showing are in the adjustments . ” “ Each dataset pushed down the 1940s warming and pushed up the current warming . ” “ You would think that when you make adjustments you ’d sometimes get warming and sometimes get cooling . That ’s almost never happened . ” What this means , the report concludes , is that claims by NASA , NOAA , and the UK Met Office that the world is experiencing unprecedented and dramatic warming should be taken with a huge pinch of salt : they all use the same corrupted global average temperature ( GAST ) data . The conclusive findings of this research are that the three GAST data sets are not a valid representation of reality . In fact , the magnitude of their historical data adjustments , that removed their cyclical temperature patterns , are totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data . Thus , it is impossible to conclude from the three published GAST data sets that recent years have been the warmest ever – despite current claims of record setting warming .","['Misleading', 'Inaccurate', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/flooding-of-coast-caused-by-global-warming-has-already-begun-justin-gillis-the-new-york-times/,"NORFOLK , Va. — Huge vertical rulers are sprouting beside low spots in the streets here , so people can judge if the tidal floods that increasingly inundate their roads are too deep to drive through . Five hundred miles down the Atlantic Coast , the only road to Tybee Island , Ga. , is disappearing beneath the sea several times a year , cutting the town off from the mainland . And another 500 miles on , in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , increased tidal flooding is forcing the city to spend millions fixing battered roads and drains — and , at times , to send out giant vacuum trucks to suck saltwater off the streets . For decades , as the global warming created by human emissions caused land ice to melt and ocean water to expand , scientists warned that the accelerating rise of the sea would eventually imperil the United States ’ coastline . Now , those warnings are no longer theoretical : The inundation of the coast has begun . The sea has crept up to the point that a high tide and a brisk wind are all it takes to send water pouring into streets and homes . Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called “ sunny - day flooding ” — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years . The sea is now so near the brim in many places that they believe the problem is likely to worsen quickly . Shifts in the Pacific Ocean mean that the West Coast , partly spared over the past two decades , may be hit hard , too . These tidal floods are often just a foot or two deep , but they can stop traffic , swamp basements , damage cars , kill lawns and forests , and poison wells with salt . Moreover , the high seas interfere with the drainage of storm water . In coastal regions , that compounds the damage from the increasingly heavy rains plaguing the country , like those that recently caused extensive flooding in Louisiana . Scientists say these rains are also a consequence of human greenhouse emissions . “ Once impacts become noticeable , they ’re going to be upon you quickly , ” said William V. Sweet , a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Silver Spring , Md. , who is among the leaders in research on coastal inundation . “ It ’s not a hundred years off — it ’s now . ” Local governments , under pressure from annoyed citizens , are beginning to act . Elections are being won on promises to invest money to protect against flooding . Miami Beach is leading the way , increasing local fees to finance a $ 400 million plan that includes raising streets , installing pumps and elevating sea walls . In many of the worst - hit cities , mayors of both parties are sounding an alarm . “ I ’m a Republican , but I also realize , by any objective analysis , the sea level is rising , ” said Jason Buelterman , the mayor of tiny Tybee Island , one of the first Georgia communities to adopt a detailed climate plan . But the local leaders say they can not tackle this problem alone . They are pleading with state and federal governments for guidance and help , including billions to pay for flood walls , pumps and road improvements that would buy them time . Yet Congress has largely ignored these pleas , and has even tried to block plans by the military to head off future problems at the numerous bases imperiled by a rising sea . A Republican congressman from Colorado , Ken Buck , recently called one military proposal part of a “ radical climate change agenda . ” The gridlock in Washington means the United States lacks not only a broad national policy on sea - level rise , it has something close to the opposite : The federal government spends billions of taxpayer dollars in ways that add to the risks , by subsidizing local governments and homeowners who build in imperiled locations along the coast . As the problem worsens , experts are warning that national security is on the line . Naval bases , in particular , are threatened ; they can hardly be moved away from the ocean , yet much of their land is at risk of disappearing within this century . “ It ’s as if the country was being attacked along every border , simultaneously , ” said Andrea Dutton , a climate scientist at the University of Florida and one of the world ’s leading experts on rising seas . “ It ’s a slow , gradual attack , but it threatens the safety and security of the United States . ” ‘ We ’re Living It ’ One night eight years ago , Karen Speights , a Norfolk resident , was sitting at the dinner table with her mother , eating crab legs dipped in butter and a tangy sauce . She felt a tingle . “ Ma ! ” she cried . “ My feet are wet ! ” Her mother laughed , but then she felt it , too : a house that had not flooded since the family moved there in 1964 was soon awash in saltwater . Ms. Speights initially hoped that flood was a fluke . Instead , it turned out to be the first of three to hit their home in less than a decade . Nowadays , Ms. Speights , an administrative worker at a utility company , is wondering how to get her and her mother out of the neighborhood before the water comes again , without taking too much of a financial hit . And she pays more attention to problems that once seemed remote , like warnings from scientists about the rising sea . “ I believe it because we ’re living it , ” Ms. Speights said as she sat on her sofa , nodding toward the nearby tidal marsh that sent water into her living room .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/wall-street-journal-commentary-grossly-misleads-readers-about-science-of-sea-level-rise-fred-singer/,"Of all known and imagined consequences of climate change , many people fear sea - level rise most . But efforts to determine what causes seas to rise are marred by poor data and disagreements about methodology . The noted oceanographer Walter Munk referred to sea - level rise as an “ enigma ” ; it has also been called a riddle and a puzzle . It is generally thought that sea - level rise accelerates mainly by thermal expansion of sea water , the so - called steric component . But by studying a very short time interval , it is possible to sidestep most of the complications , like “ isostatic adjustment ” of the shoreline ( as continents rise after the overlying ice has melted ) and “ subsidence ” of the shoreline ( as ground water and minerals are extracted ) . I chose to assess the sea - level trend from 1915 - 45 , when a genuine , independently confirmed warming of approximately 0.5 degree Celsius occurred . I note particularly that sea - level rise is not affected by the warming ; it continues at the same rate , 1.8 millimeters a year , according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr . I therefore conclude — contrary to the general wisdom — that the temperature of sea water has no direct effect on sea - level rise . That means neither does the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide . This conclusion is worth highlighting : It shows that sea - level rise does not depend on the use of fossil fuels . The evidence should allay fear that the release of additional CO2 will increase sea - level rise . But there is also good data showing sea levels are in fact rising at a constant rate . The trend has been measured by a network of tidal gauges , many of which have been collecting data for over a century . The cause of the trend is a puzzle . Physics demands that water expand as its temperature increases . But to keep the rate of rise constant , as observed , expansion of sea water evidently must be offset by something else . What could that be ? I conclude that it must be ice accumulation , through evaporation of ocean water , and subsequent precipitation turning into ice . Evidence suggests that accumulation of ice on the Antarctic continent has been offsetting the steric effect for at least several centuries . It is difficult to explain why evaporation of seawater produces approximately 100 % cancellation of expansion . My method of analysis considers two related physical phenomena : thermal expansion of water and evaporation of water molecules . But if evaporation offsets thermal expansion , the net effect is of course close to zero . What then is the real cause of sea - level rise of 1 to 2 millimeters a year ? Melting of glaciers and ice sheets adds water to the ocean and causes sea levels to rise . ( Recall though that the melting of floating sea ice adds no water to the oceans , and hence does not affect the sea level . ) After the rapid melting away of northern ice sheets , the slow melting of Antarctic ice at the periphery of the continent may be the main cause of current sea - level rise . All this , because it is much warmer now than 12,000 years ago , at the end of the most recent glaciation . Yet there is little heat available in the Antarctic to support melting . We can see melting happening right now at the Ross Ice Shelf of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet . Geologists have tracked Ross ’s slow disappearance , and glaciologist Robert Bindschadler predicts the ice shelf will melt completely within about 7,000 years , gradually raising the sea level as it goes . Of course , a lot can happen in 7,000 years . The onset of a new glaciation could cause the sea level to stop rising . It could even fall 400 feet , to the level at the last glaciation maximum 18,000 years ago . Currently , sea - level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature , and certainly not on CO2 . We can expect the sea to continue rising at about the present rate for the foreseeable future . By 2100 the seas will rise another 6 inches or so — a far cry from Al Gore ’s alarming numbers . There is nothing we can do about rising sea levels in the meantime . We ’d better build dikes and sea walls a little bit higher .","['Misleading', 'Inaccurate', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/popular-story-fox2news-accurately-describes-2017-global-temperature-sea-ice-extent-cnn/,"NASA posted this video to YouTube with this description , “ Arctic sea ice has not only been shrinking in surface area in recent years , it ’s becoming younger and thinner as well . In this animation , where the ice cover almost looks gelatinous as it pulses through the seasons , cryospheric scientist Dr. Walt Meier of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center describes how the sea ice has undergone fundamental changes during the era of satellite measurements . ” 2017 was once again one of the hottest years on record , ranked as the second - warmest by NASA and third - warmest by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . The findings “ continue the planet ’s long - term warming trend , ” according to NASA . A trend that is driven predominately by human activity through carbon dioxide emissions . Temperature records for the planet , monitored independently by both agencies , go back to 1880 . The announcement came at a joint press conference on Thursday in Washington . The hottest year on record remains 2016 , while 2015 ranks second according to NOAA and third by NASA , which means the top three years have been the most recent three . Though 2017 was slightly cooler on average compared to 2016 . the trend towards a warmer planet has never been clearer . The six hottest years have all occurred since 2010 and 17 of the 18 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001 . According to NASA , the globally averaged temperature of the land and ocean was 0.9˚C ( 1.62˚F ) above the 20th century average . This puts us well over halfway to the ambitious target of limiting warming to 1.5˚ C ( 2.7˚F ) set in the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement . Scientists believe if that if we are to avoid exceeding that limit , carbon emissions would need to be significantly reduced starting immediately . La Niña not enough to cool us down The slight downturn in temperatures this year can be partially explained by the presence of La Niña , which began in late 2016 and lasted into 2017 and returned late in the year — whereas a robust El Niño was in place during portions of 2015 and 2016 . El Niño is characterized by a warming of the surface waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean — which tends to drive up global temperatures . Therefore years containing El Niños tend to be warmer globally than other years . La Niñas , on the other hand , feature cooler than average waters in the Pacific , and tend to cool the planet down . The fact that 2017 was the second- or third - warmest year on record , despite the presence of a cooling La Niña , speaks to the overall warming trend the Earth is experiencing thanks to overall global warming . According to NASA , if “ the effects of the recent El Niño and La Niña patterns were statistically removed from the record , 2017 would have been the warmest year on record . ” Global climate highlights of 2017 Sea ice continued its declining trend , both in the Arctic and Antarctic . The Antarctic , which was trending at record high levels just a few years ago , reached a record low during 2017 , with ice covering 154,000 fewer square miles than the previous record low set in 1986 . In the Arctic , sea ice extent was the second - lowest since records began in 1979 , behind only 2016 , though record low sea ice was observed during the winter months of January - March . Temperatures significantly warmer than normal around the planet did not mean there was a lack of snow , however . In the northern hemisphere , the average snow cover extent was the largest since 1985 and the eighth largest since records began in 1968 , according to Rutgers University ’s Global Snow Lab . 2017 also featured a number of extreme weather events , most notably the record number of major hurricanes impacting the US and Caribbean , which led to the costliest year for weather disasters in US history .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/james-taylor-2015-was-not-even-close-to-hottest-year-on-record/,"Forget what global warming activists would lead you to believe – 2015 was not even close to the hottest year on record . Satellite temperature readings going back to 1979 show 1998 was by far the warmest year in the satellite era , followed by 2010 . 2015 comes in third . And these results are only for the period since 1979 . 2015 should have been warmer . This past year saw what is likely the most powerful El Nino during the satellite temperature record . With a record El Nino , we should have experienced record high temperatures . Yet we did n’t . A record El Nino resulting in less - than - record temperatures is another sign that global warming is not all that activists crack it up to be . Indeed , if a record strong El Nino can not bring global temperatures back to the warmth of 1998 , what can – and when will that be ? 18 years after 1998 , global warming still has not created the runaway warming we were told to expect . Of course , it is not too difficult for activists to paint a picture of an exceptionally warm world – record El Nino or not – when they conveniently define “ the record ” as merely extending back to the late 1800s . Global warming activists do not extend “ the record ” back any further , they say , because it has only been since the late 1800s that we have had a global network of mercury thermometers . But we do have other reliable indicators of temperatures before the late 1800s , and the evidence shows temperatures have been warmer than today for most of the past several thousand years , including warmer - than - present temperatures for most of the human civilization time period . Scientists measuring oxygen isotopes from ice cores drilled in Greenland and Antarctica ( among other methods ) report that temperatures were significantly warmer than today for most of the past 10,000 years . With the exception of the Little Ice Age , which lasted from approximately 1300 - 1850 and which almost ushered in a full - blown new ice age epoch , current temperatures remain cooler than almost all other time periods in human history . So how do global warming activists get away with raising constant alarm and making such outrageous claims as 2015 being the hottest ever ? The answer is misleading head - fakes , doctored temperature records , and a compliant media that is more than willing to push the agenda of global warming activists . No , Virginia , 2015 was not the hottest year on record . In fact , it was n’t even close . Update Jan. 25 , 2016 : As I predicted in this article , global warming activists have indeed made a full - blown public relations effort to claim 2015 was the warmest year on record . This calls for a little more discussion of the relative reliability of satellite temperature measurements , surface temperature measurements , and adjusted surface temperature measurements . National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) instruments aboard NASA satellites use microwave frequencies to measure the radiance of the Earth . Scientists then apply objective mathematical formulas to produce precise temperature measurements from the radiance data . For temperature readings , the measurements focus on readings at approximately 10,000 feet ( about two miles ) above the Earth ’s surface , where physics tell us the warming impacts of accumulating carbon dioxide should be moderately stronger than at the Earth ’s surface . In other words , the satellite data is objective , precise , and should report moderately more warming than at the Earth ’s surface . By contrast , temperature measurements at the Earth ’s surface are less reliable . Temperature stations are not uniformly distributed like the atmospheric sampling of satellite instruments . Population growth and the effects of creeping urbanization create urban heat islands of local warmth that have nothing to do with greenhouse gases or global warming . Changes in land use at or near surface temperature stations also impact temperature readings . For these and other reasons , surface temperature readings lack the precision and consistent quality of satellite temperature data . We do , however , have some means of attempting to pull accurate temperature data from surface temperature stations . For example , some surface temperature stations are located at sites better insulated from artificial temperature signals and are better maintained than others . Data from these surface temperature stations should be afforded more confidence than data from more suspect locations and stations . As I recently reported at Forbes.com , a study presented last month at the American Geophysical Union found that well - sited and well - maintained stations report significantly less warming than the surface station network as a whole . Government overseers collect the raw temperature data from the full network of surface stations and then produce temperature summaries for public distribution . One would expect that the government overseers would simply report the raw data that was collected . In the alternative , one might expect the government overseers to adjust the recent temperature data downward to reflect the false warming signal of creeping urbanization and the studies showing uncorrupted surface temperature stations report less warming than the full network of corrupted and uncorrupted temperature stations . Instead , and remarkably , government overseers adjust the data to add more recent warming than is being reported in the raw temperature readings . Only after government overseers make these highly suspect adjustments are temperature “ records ” capable of showing anything approaching record warmth . Ultimately , we must decide on a hierarchy of accuracy and reliability for temperature “ reports .","['Inaccurate', 'Cherry-picking', 'Derogatory', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Biased']"

It would n’t stop global warming but : “ You ’ll sure have an impoverished dark country . ” he continues . “ Global warming is why hurricanes are getting worse ” and the idea that “ carbon dioxide is a pollutant that just does harm ” are two other myths the scientists debunk .

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/arctic-will-be-ice-free-in-summer-next-year-robin-mckie-peter-wadhams-the-guardian/,"Peter Wadhams has spent his career in the Arctic , making more than 50 trips there , some in submarines under the polar ice . He is credited with being one of the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink . He was director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge from 1987 to 1992 and professor of ocean physics at Cambridge since 2001 . His book , A Farewell to Ice , tells the story of his unravelling of this alarming trend and describes what the consequences for our planet will be if Arctic ice continues to disappear at its current rate . You have said on several occasions that summer Arctic sea ice would disappear by the middle of this decade . It has n’t . Are you being alarmist ? No . There is a clear trend down to zero for summer cover . However , each year chance events can give a boost to ice cover or take some away . The overall trend is a very strong downward one , however . Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic ’s summer sea - ice cover . Next year or the year after that , I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice - free . You will be able to cross over the north pole by ship . There will still be about a million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic in summer but it will be packed into various nooks and crannies along the Northwest Passage and along bits of the Canadian coastline . Ice - free means the central basin of the Arctic will be ice - free and I think that that is going to happen in summer 2017 or 2018 . Why should we be concerned about an Arctic that is free of ice in summer ? People tend to think of an ice - free Arctic in summer in terms of it merely being a symbol of global change . Things happen , they say . In fact , the impact will be profound and will effect the whole planet and its population . One key effect will be albedo feedback . Sea ice reflects about 50 % of the solar radiation it receives back into space . By contrast , water reflects less than 10 % . So if you replace ice with water , which is darker , much more solar heat will be absorbed by the ocean and the planet will heat up even more rapidly than it is doing at present . Sea ice also acts as an air - conditioning system . Winds coming over the sea to land masses such as Siberia and Greenland will no longer be cooled as they pass over ice and these places will be heated even further . These effects could add 50 % to the impact of global warming that is produced by rising carbon emissions . What will be the effects of this accelerating increase in temperatures ? The air over Greenland will get warmer and more and more of its ice will melt . It is already losing about 300 cubic kilometres of ice a year . Antarctica is adding to the melt as well . Sea - level rises will accelerate as a result . The most recent prediction of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) is that seas will rise by 60 to 90 centimetres this century . I think a rise of one to two metres is far more likely . Indeed , it is probably the best we can hope for . That may not sound a lot but it is really very serious . It will increase enormously the frequency of storm surges all over the world . We may be able to raise the Thames barrier in Britain but in Bangladesh , it just means more and more people will be drowned . Global warming is generally associated with increased fossil - fuel burning and consequent rises in levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide . But is that the only climate problem we face ? No it is not . We also have the issue of methane . Russian scientists who have investigated waters off their coast have detected more and more plumes of methane bubbling up from the seabed . The reason this is happening is closely connected with the warming of the planet and the shrinking of the Arctic icecaps . Until around 2005 , even in summer , you still had sea ice near the coast . Then it started to disappear , so that for three or four months a year warm water reached the shallow waters around the shores where there had been permafrost ground since the last ice age . It has started to melt with dangerous consequences . Underneath the permafrost there are sediments full of methane hydrates . When the permafrost goes , you release the pressure on top of these hydrates and the methane comes out of solution . Can we monitor this methane just as we can monitor carbon dioxide ? Yes , we can measure methane over large areas using satellites . These have shown that methane levels that had been fairly flat for most of the last century have started to rise and are accelerating , often with little outliers on the graph . There is a scientist called Jason Box who works in Denmark for the Greenland Survey and he calls these outliers dragon ’s breath . They are not some sort of measurement caused by dodgy instruments . They are real pulses of methane coming from offshore flumes . How intense is methane as a heater of the atmosphere compared with carbon dioxide ? It is 23 times more powerful .","['Alarmist', 'Misleading']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/conservative-tribune-post-falsely-claims-cancelled-arctic-research-cruise-is-evidence-against-climate-change-benjamin-arie/,"You can say this for bleeding - heart liberals : They certainly have a flair for the ironic . An expedition designed to gather evidence of global warming and “ climate change ” in the Arctic was canceled last month after a humiliating discovery was made : There was so much ice in the Arctic that the icebreaker it was going to use was needed elsewhere . Yes , you read that right . It ’s the return of left - leaning scientists ’ famous nemesis , “ Reality . ” And this time it affected plans for the research vessel Amundsen , which can be redirected by the Canadian Coast Guard if its icebreaking capabilities are required to clear lanes for fishing boats or supply vessels , such as oil tankers , according to the Winnipeg Free Press . “ The Science Team of the Canadian Research Icebreaker CCGS Amundsen has cancelled the first leg of the 2017 Expedition due to complications associated with the southward motion of hazardous Arctic sea ice , ” the news site Science Daily reported . Keep in mind that the Amundsen is no lightweight ship . “ It ’s the second most powerful icebreaker in the country and we had trouble getting through the sea ice , ” David Barber , an arctic research expert , told the Free Press . The mission was n’t exactly cheap , either . “ Timing was key for this $ 17 million , four - year , University of Manitoba - led project , ” Science Daily explained . “ The need to deal with extreme ice conditions in the south meant the ship would arrive too late on site to meet research objectives . ” Scientists connected to the planned mission stated in no uncertain terms that they had not expected the heavy ice to be present . “ It became clear to me very quickly that these were n’t just heavy ice conditions , these were unprecedented ice conditions , ” Dr. David Barber , the lead scientist on the study , admitted to Vice Magazine . “ We were finding thick multi - year sea ice floes which on level ice were five meters thick … it was much , much thicker and much , much heavier than anything you would expect at that latitude and at that time of year , ” he continued . It is n’t the first time a global warming study has been ironically halted in its tracks . “ There was the Ship of Fools expedition in which an Australian climate researcher called Chris Turkey had to call an expedition to the melting Antarctic after his ship got stuck in the ice , ” recalled Breitbart News contributor James Delingpole . “ The Caitlin Expedition – supported by the Prince of Wales – in which Pen Haddow and his team had to abandon their trip to the North Pole because it was colder than they ’d expected , ” he continued . “ Most recently there was Ship of Fools II , in which a global warming research voyage by David Hempleman Adams had to be curtailed because of unexpected ice . ” Have you noticed a trend ? The problem with the proponents of man - made climate change theories is n’t that they might be wrong . The real issue is the arrogance and zealotry found in people who see science not as an ongoing process , but as a religion . There is a difference between science and “ scientism . ” It is n’t an all - knowing oracle that is absolutely right all of the time . In fact , theories and explanations must frequently be wrong if science is properly advancing . The simple fact is , humans know very little about the climate cycles of our world . Recognizing that skepticism and asking challenging questions are part of good science , yet climate change radicals have made their politically fueled narrative more important than the truth . It looks like the Arctic Ocean missed the memo and is n’t playing along with the liberal talking points . Reality has a way of being very persistent — and that ’s something leftists still have n’t figured out .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Derogatory', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/cnn-accurately-covers-latest-ipcc-report-brandon-miller/,"CNN — Governments around the world must take “ rapid , far - reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society ” to avoid disastrous levels of global warming , says a stark new report from the global scientific authority on climate change . The report issued Monday by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , says the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) above pre - industrial levels by as early as 2030 , precipitating the risk of extreme drought , wildfires , floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people . The date , which falls well within the lifetime of many people alive today , is based on current levels of greenhouse gas emissions . The planet is already two - thirds of the way there , with global temperatures having warmed about 1 degree C. Avoiding going even higher will require significant action in the next few years . “ This is concerning because we know there are so many more problems if we exceed 1.5 degrees C global warming , including more heatwaves and hot summers , greater sea level rise , and , for many parts of the world , worse droughts and rainfall extremes , ” Andrew King , a lecturer in climate science at the University of Melbourne , said in a statement . Global net emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by 45 % from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach “ net zero ” around 2050 in order to keep the warming around 1.5 degrees C. Lowering emissions to this degree , while technically possible , would require widespread changes in energy , industry , buildings , transportation and cities , the report says . “ The window on keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C is closing rapidly and the current emissions pledges made by signatories to the Paris Agreement do not add up to us achieving that goal , ” added King . The report makes it clear that climate change is already happening – and what comes next could be even worse , unless urgent international political action is taken . Consequences of past inaction “ One of the key messages that comes out very strongly from this report is that we are already seeing the consequences of 1 degree C of global warming through more extreme weather , rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice , among other changes , ” said Panmao Zhai , co - chair of IPCC Working Group I. Even if warming is kept at or just below 1.5 degrees C , the impacts will be widespread and significant . Temperatures during summer heatwaves , such as those just experienced across Europe this summer , can be expected to increase by 3 degrees C says the report . More frequent or intense droughts , such as the one that nearly ran the taps dry in Cape Town , South Africa , as well as more frequent extreme rainfall events such as hurricanes Harvey and Florence in the United States , are also pointed to as expectations as we reach the warming threshold . Coral reefs will also be drastically affected , with between 70 and 90 % expected to die off , including Australia ’s Great Barrier Reef . Countries in the southern hemisphere will be among the worse off , the report said , “ projected to experience the largest impacts on economic growth due to climate change should global warming increase . ” The report underlines how even the smallest increase in the base target would worsen the impact of recent natural disasters . “ Every extra bit of warming matters , especially since warming of 1.5 degrees C or higher increases the risk associated with long - lasting or irreversible changes , such as the loss of some ecosystems , ” said Hans - Otto Pörtner , Co - Chair of IPCC Working Group II . The report cites specific examples of how impacts of global warming would be lessened with the 1.5 degrees C increase , compared to the 2 degrees C increase : Global sea levels would rise 10 cm lower by 2100 . The likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century , instead of at least once per decade . Coral reefs would decline by 70 % to 90 % instead of being almost completely wiped out . ’ Possible with the laws of chemistry and physics ’ Monday ’s report is three years in the making and is a direct result of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement . In the Paris accord , 197 countries agreed to the goal of holding global temperatures “ well below ” 2 degrees C above pre - industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C. The United States was initially in the agreement , but President Donald Trump pulled the country out a year and half later , claiming it was unfair to the country . To limit global warming to 1.5 degree C is “ possible within the laws of chemistry and physics , ” said Jim Skea , co - chair of IPCC Working Group III . “ But doing so would require unprecedented changes . ” “ International cooperation is absolutely imperative to limit emissions and therefore global warming and its impacts , as well as coordinating effective and widespread adaptation and mitigation , ” said Sarah Perkins - Kirkpatrick , a fellow at the Climate Change Research Center at the University of New South Wales . “ The next few years will be critical in the evolution of these efforts . ” One key issue will be negative emissions , large scale carbon - scrubbing technologies that can reduce the amount in the atmosphere and act to counter continued pollution . According to the report , there are two main ways of removing carbon from the atmosphere : increasing natural processes that already do this , and experimental carbon storage or removal technologies .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/national-geographic-video-starving-polar-bear-should-have-clarified-uncertain-link-climate-change-sarah-gibbens/,"When photographer Paul Nicklen and filmmakers from conservation group Sea Legacy arrived on Somerset Island — near the larger Baffin Island — in the Canadian Arctic in late summer , they came across a heartbreaking sight : a starving polar bear on its deathbed . Nicklen is no stranger to bears . From the time he was a child growing up in Canada 's far north the biologist turned wildlife photographer has seen over 3,000 bears in the wild . But the emaciated polar bear , featured in videos Nicklen published to social media on December 5 , was one of the most gut - wrenching sights he 's ever seen . "" We stood there crying — filming with tears rolling down our cheeks , "" he said . Video shows the polar bear clinging to life , its white hair limply covering its thin , bony frame . One of the bear 's back legs drags behind it as it walks , likely due to muscle atrophy . Looking for food , the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers . It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground . In the days since Nicklen posted the footage , he 's been asked why he did n’t intervene . "" Of course , that crossed my mind , "" said Nicklen . "" But it 's not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat . "" And even if he did , said Nicklen , he only would have been prolonging the bear 's misery . Plus , feeding wild polar bears is illegal in Canada . The wildlife photographer says he filmed the bear 's slow , beleaguered death because he did n't want it to die in vain . "" When scientists say bears are going extinct , I want people to realize what it looks like . Bears are going to starve to death , "" said Nicklen . "" This is what a starving bear looks like . "" The Climate Change Link ? By telling the story of one polar bear , Nicklen hopes to convey a larger message about how a warming climate has deadly consequences . Polar bears have long been unwitting mascots for the effects of climate change . As animals that live only in Arctic regions , they 're often the first to feel the impacts of warming temperatures and rising seas . The large , half - ton bears find concentrations of seals on sea ice . During summer months , it 's not uncommon for polar bears to go months without eating while they wait for Arctic ice to solidify . In 2002 , a World Wildlife Fund report predicted that climate change could eventually lead to polar bear endangerment or extinction . Even then , the report found that polar bears were moving from ice to land earlier and staying on land longer , unhealthily extending the bears ' fasting season . By the end of summer , most bears studied by the World Wildlife Fund showed signs of starvation . Fifteen years later , polar bears ' icy hunting grounds are in even worse shape . The National Snow and Ice Data Center , which tracks sea ice cover annually , has regularly noted record lows in sea ice coverage — a decline that is expected to only get worse . ( Read more about drastic predictions for dwindling sea ice . ) A study recently published in the journal Biosciences looked at how climate science is often falsely discredited . The study found climate deniers are able to downplay the threat of climate change by discrediting the threat facing polar bears . See Photos of Polar Bears in the Wild However , a study published last year by the European Geosciences Union and this year by the U.S. Geological Survey confirms melting sea ice continues to be an existential threat to polar bears .","['Sound_reasoning', 'Misleading']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/brad-plumer-el-nino-explained-why-this-years-could-be-one-of-the-strongest-on-record/,"Over the past year , scientists have been keeping a close eye on an important swath of the Pacific Ocean , just along the equator . When conditions here get just right , an El Niño can form — wreaking havoc on weather patterns across the globe . The El Niño currently brewing in the Pacific is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever recorded . This phenomenon is expected to peak before January , with far - reaching impacts all winter and spring . Based on past experience , El Niño could potentially bring much - needed rain to California , but also drought in Australia , destructive floods in Peru , and so on . El Niño has already helped make 2015 the hottest year on record — and might well do the same for 2016 . That said , El Niño events are often unpredictable and full of surprises . So what follows is a guide to how El Niño works , what we know about the 2015 event , and how a potentially massive El Niño could upend the world 's weather over the coming months . A very basic definition of El Niño El Niño is a weather phenomenon that occurs irregularly in the eastern tropical Pacific every two to seven years . When the trade winds that usually blow from east to west weaken , sea surface temperatures start rising , setting off a chain of atmospheric impacts . El Niños can be strong or weak . Strong events can temporarily disrupt weather patterns around the world , typically making certain regions wetter ( Peru or California , say ) and others drier ( Southeast Asia ) . Some countries suffer major damage as a result . El Niños also transfer heat stored in the deeper layers of the ocean to the surface . When combined with global warming , that can lead to record hot years , as in 1998 . "" El Niño "" got its name in the 1800s from Peruvian fisherman , who first noticed a mysterious warm current that would appear around Christmas . They called it the "" little boy "" or "" Christ child . "" Why this year 's El Niño is a huge deal The last truly massive El Niño appeared in 1997-'98 and ended up causing an estimated $ 35 billion in destruction and 23,000 deaths around the world . ( It also inspired that famous Chris Farley sketch . ) Now we 're facing a similarly massive event : That , in itself , is a surprise . Back in March , NOAA 's Climate Prediction Center announced that a weak El Niño had formed in the Pacific , but many experts initially thought it might fizzle out by summer . Instead , this El Niño kept strengthening , with ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific continuing to soar . By mid - November , temperatures in one critical part of the ocean , the Niño 3.4 region , were running even hotter than they were in 1997 : "" Right now we say we think it 's really going to be one of the three strongest ones , "" said Michel Jarraud , the secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization , who compared it with the 1997 - 98 , 1982 - 83 , and 1972 - 73 El Niño events . "" It may be one of the two ; that we do n't know yet . But definitely it 's already a very strong one . "" Countries across the globe will have to brace themselves as this event peaks this winter and lasts through the spring . El Niño has already triggered longer droughts in Indonesia , enabling massive man - made peatland fires to rage out of control , creating toxic haze that has spread as far as Singapore . Warmer ocean temperatures have also caused a major coral bleaching event , harming reefs around the world . And El Niño may just be getting started : In the past , major events have brought unusually hot , dry weather to Australia that can cramp wheat yields and amp up wildfires . It can bring hotter , drier weather to India that hurts agriculture . It can bring heavy rain and destructive flooding to Peru , washing away houses and spreading cholera . That said , El Niño is n't all bad . In the United States , it could bring some needed rain this winter to ease California 's drought ( though also deadly mudslides and flooding ) . Historically , El Niño has also served up milder US winters and tamped down on Atlantic hurricanes . One important caveat , however , is that every El Niño unfolds a bit differently — and some have unexpected impacts . As NOAA 's Emily Becker points out , strong El Niño events usually bring rain to California in the winter ( as in 1982-'83 ) , but occasionally they do n't ( as in 1965-'66 ): Another key story to watch is how a strong El Niño might push up temperatures worldwide . Global average temperatures are already going up over time , thanks to all the carbon dioxide we 're adding to the atmosphere . According to NASA , 2014 was the hottest year on record . But there was no El Niño that year — and El Niño years tend to be a bit hotter than average , as heat gets transferred from the ocean to the surface . The combination of El Niño and rising CO2 is already helping 2015 shatter heat records . The big question now is whether it 'll do the same for 2016 : Bottom line : There are still a lot of question marks about how this will unfold . But El Niño could well be the biggest weather story of the next several months , with ripple effects around the globe .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-article-on-arctic-methane-emissions-lacks-important-context-jonathan-watts/,"Scientists say they have found evidence that frozen methane deposits in the Arctic Ocean have started to be released over a large area of the continental slope off the East Siberian coast , the Guardian can reveal . High levels of the potent greenhouse gas have been detected down to a depth of 350 metres in the Laptev Sea near Russia , prompting concern among researchers that the discovery could have “ serious climate consequences ” . The slope sediments in the Arctic contain a huge quantity of frozen methane and other gases – known as hydrates . Methane has a warming effect 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide over 20 years . The United States Geological Survey has previously listed Arctic hydrate destabilisation as one of four most serious scenarios for abrupt climate change . The international team onboard the Russian research ship R / V Akademik Keldysh said most of the bubbles were currently dissolving in the water but methane levels at the surface were four to eight times what would normally be expected and this was venting into the atmosphere . “ At this moment , there is unlikely to be any major impact on global warming , but the point is that this process has now been triggered . This East Siberian slope methane hydrate system has been perturbed and the process will be ongoing , ” said the Swedish scientist Örjan Gustafsson , of Stockholm University , in a satellite call from the vessel . The scientists – who are part of a multi - year International Shelf Study Expedition – stressed their findings were preliminary . Methane seeps detected in the past were found to be historic , but the expedition believes these are new based on an earlier study showing movement of the subsea permafrost between the early 1980s and 2015 . The scale of methane releases will not be confirmed until they return , analyse the data and have their studies published in a peer - reviewed journal . But the discovery of potentially destabilised slope frozen methane raises concerns about the potential impact on the speed of global heating . The Arctic is considered ground zero in the debate about the vulnerability of frozen methane deposits – which have been called the “ sleeping giants of the carbon cycle ” - in the ocean , and if releases were to exceed a tipping point it could increase the speed of global heating . With the Arctic temperature now rising more than twice as fast as the global average , the question of when – or even whether – they will be released into the atmosphere has been a matter of considerable uncertainty in climate computer models . The 60 - member team on the Akademik Keldysh believe they are the first to observationally confirm the methane release is already under way across a wide area of the slope about 600 km offshore . At six monitoring points over a slope area 150 km in length and 10 km wide , they saw clouds of bubbles released from sediment . At one location on the Laptev Sea slope at a depth of about 300 metres they found methane concentrations of up to 1,600 nanomoles per litre , which is 400 times higher than would be expected if the sea and the atmosphere were in equilibrium . Igor Semiletov , of the Russian Academy of Sciences , who is the chief scientist onboard , said the discharges were “ significantly larger ” than anything found before . “ The discovery of actively releasing shelf slope hydrates is very important and unknown until now , ” he said . “ This is a new page . Potentially they can have serious climate consequences , but we need more study before we can confirm that . ” The most likely cause of the instability is an intrusion of warm Atlantic currents into the east Arctic . This “ Atlantification ” is driven by human - induced climate disruption . The latest discovery potentially marks the third source of methane emissions from the region . Semiletov , who has been studying this area for two decades , has previously reported the gas is being released from the shelf of the Arctic – the biggest of any sea . For the second year in a row , his team have found crater - like pockmarks in the shallower parts of the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea that are discharging bubble jets of methane , which is reaching the sea surface at levels tens to hundreds of times higher than normal . This is similar to the craters and sinkholes reported from inland Siberian tundra earlier this autumn . Temperatures in Siberia were 5C higher than average from January to June this year , an anomaly that was made at least 600 times more likely by human - caused emissions of carbon dioxide and methane . Last winter ’s sea ice melted unusually early . This winter ’s freeze has yet to begin , already a later start than at any time on record .","['Cherry-picking', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/wall-street-journal-op-ed-economic-consequences-climate-change-found-naive-scientists-david-henderson-john-cochrane/,"Climate change is often misunderstood as a package deal : If global warming is “ real , ” both sides of the debate seem to assume , the climate lobby ’s policy agenda follows inexorably . It does not . Climate policy advocates need to do a much better job of quantitatively analyzing economic costs and the actual , rather than symbolic , benefits of their policies . Skeptics would also do well to focus more attention on economic and policy analysis . To arrive at a wise policy response , we first need to consider how much economic damage climate change will do . Current models struggle to come up with economic costs commensurate with apocalyptic political rhetoric . Typical costs are well below 10 % of gross domestic product in the year 2100 and beyond . That ’s a lot of money — but it ’s a lot of years , too . Even 10 % less GDP in 100 years corresponds to 0.1 percentage point less annual GDP growth . Climate change therefore does not justify policies that cost more than 0.1 percentage point of growth . If the goal is 10 % more GDP in 100 years , pro - growth tax , regulatory and entitlement reforms would be far more effective . Yes , the costs are not evenly spread . Some places will do better and some will do worse . The American South might be a worse place to grow wheat ; Southern Canada might be a better one . In a century , Miami might find itself in approximately the same situation as the Dutch city of Rotterdam today . But spread over a century , the costs of moving and adapting are not as imposing as they seem . Rotterdam ’s dikes are expensive , but not prohibitively so . Most buildings are rebuilt about every 50 years . If we simply stopped building in flood - prone areas and started building on higher ground , even the costs of moving cities would be bearable . Migration is costly . But much of the world ’s population moved from farms to cities in the 20th century . Allowing people to move to better climates in the 21st will be equally possible . Such investments in climate adaptation are small compared with the investments we will regularly make in houses , businesses , infrastructure and education . And economics is the central question — unlike with other environmental problems such as chemical pollution . Carbon dioxide hurts nobody ’s health . It ’s good for plants . Climate change need not endanger anyone . If it did — and you do hear such claims — then living in hot Arizona rather than cool Maine , or living with Louisiana ’s frequent floods , would be considered a health catastrophe today . Global warming is not the only risk our society faces . Even if science tells us that climate change is real and man - made , it does not tell us , as President Obama asserted , that climate change is the greatest threat to humanity . Really ? Greater than nuclear explosions , a world war , global pandemics , crop failures and civil chaos ? No . Healthy societies do not fall apart over slow , widely predicted , relatively small economic adjustments of the sort painted by climate analysis . Societies do fall apart from war , disease or chaos . Climate policy must compete with other long - term threats for always - scarce resources . Facing this reality , some advocate that we buy some “ insurance . ” Sure , they argue , the projected economic cost seems small , but it could turn out to be a lot worse . But the same argument applies to any possible risk . If you buy overpriced insurance against every potential danger , you soon run out of money . You can sensibly insure only when the premium is in line with the risk — which brings us back where we started , to the need for quantifying probabilities , costs , benefits and alternatives . And uncertainty goes both ways . Nobody forecast fracking , or that it would make the U.S. the world ’s carbonreduction leader . Strategic waiting is a rational response to a slow - moving uncertain peril with fast - changing technology . Global warming is not even the obvious top environmental threat . Dirty water , dirty air and insect - borne diseases are a far greater problem today for most people world - wide . Habitat loss and human predation are a far greater problem for most animals . Elephants wo n’t make it to see a warmer climate . Ask them how they would prefer to spend $ 1 trillion — subsidizing high - speed trains or a human - free park the size of Montana . Then , we need to know what effect proposed policies have and at what cost . Scientific , quantifiable or even vaguely plausible cause - and - effect thinking are missing from much advocacy for policies to reduce carbon emissions . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ’s “ scientific ” recommendations , for example , include “ reduced gender inequality & marginalization in other forms , ” “ provisioning of adequate housing , ” “ cash transfers ” and “ awareness raising & integrating into education . ” Even if some of these are worthy goals , they are not scientifically valid , cost - benefit - tested policies to cool the planet . Climate policy advocates ’ apocalyptic vision demands serious analysis , and mushy thinking undermines their case . If carbon emissions pose the greatest threat to humanity , it follows that the costs of nuclear power — waste disposal and the occasional meltdown — might be bearable . It follows that the costs of genetically modified foods and modern pesticides , which can feed us with less land and lower carbon emissions , might be bearable . It follows that if the future of civilization is really at stake , adaptation or geo - engineering should not be unmentionable . And it follows that symbolic , ineffective , political grab - bag policies should be intolerable .

For former president Barack Obama , the ever - changing and often contradictory "" facts "" about global warming ( which liberals now call climate change because the globe stopped warming ) was simply "" settled science . "" But now it turns out the Arctic sea ice is thicker than ever and , oh yeah , the global temperature trend has not warmed for 19 years . That 's right -- 19 years ! The Telegraph newspaper in the UK has published a fascinating article detailing data from the Danish Meteorological Institute ( DMI ) . Ever since December temperatures in the Arctic have consistently been lower than minus 20 C. In April the extent of Arctic sea ice was back to where it was in April 13 years ago . Furthermore , whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin , this year most has been at least two metres thick . The Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than at any time for years . As for those record temperatures brought in 2016 by an exceptionally strong El Niño , the satellites now show that in recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more that 0.6 degrees : just as happened 17 years ago after a similarly strong El Niño had also made 1998 the “ hottest year on record ” . This means the global temperature trend has now shown no further warming for 19 years . But the BBC wo n’t be telling us any of this . And we are still stuck with that insanely damaging Climate Change Act , which in this election will scarcely get a mention . ​The author then goes on to decry the very real consequences to businesses and citizens from governments continuing to enact ever more stringent regulation to offset this global "" warming . "" But the real findings of the DMI are significant . The liberal media might take issue with a U.S. think tank funding a study that says global warming does n't exist -- or at least has n't for 19 years -- but they 'll accept the findings from little ol' Denmark , wo n't they ? But wait , there 's more -- much more . "" Experts told Daily Star Online planet Earth is on course for a “ Little Age Ice ” within the next three years thanks to a cocktail of climate change and low solar activity , "" the Brit paper writes on Monday . Research shows a natural cooling cycle that occurs every 230 years began in 2014 and will send temperatures plummeting even further by 2019 . Scientists are also expecting a “ huge reduction ” in solar activity for 33 years between 2020 and 2053 that will cause thermometers to crash . Both cycles suggest Earth is entering a global cooling cycle that could have devastating consequences for global economy , human life and society as we know it . If predictions of the world - wide big freeze come true , the plot to 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow would not be far from reality during winter . ... David Dilley , CEO of Global Weather Oscillations , told Daily Star Online global warming and cooling cycles are determined by the gravitational forces of the Earth , moon and sun . Each cycle lasts around 120,000 years , with sub - cycles of around 230 years . He said : “ We have had five warming cycles since about 900AD , each followed by a dramatic cooling cycle . “ The last global warming cycle ended in 1790 and the year 2020 is 230 following this – thus I have been talking about rapid cooling beginning in 2019 . ” He said the oncoming cooling will send temperatures plummeting to lows last seen in the 1940s – when the mercury bottomed out at -21C during winter in the UK . He said : “ Cooling from 2019 into about 2020 to 2021 will bring world temperatures back to where they were in the 1940s through the 1960s . By the way , the headline of the Telegraph article was perfect : "" Another Arctic ice panic over as world temperatures plummet . "" Exactly .
