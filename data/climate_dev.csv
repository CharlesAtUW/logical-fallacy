https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/destruction-of-the-amazon-forest-very-likely-contributes-to-global-warming-as-accurately-described-in-the-national-geographic-article/,"The Amazon rainforest is most likely now a net contributor to warming of the planet , according to a first - of - its - kind analysis from more than 30 scientists . For years , researchers have expressed concern that rising temperatures , drought , and deforestation are reducing the capacity of the world ’s largest rainforest to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , and help offset emissions from fossil - fuel burning . Recent studies have even suggested that some portions of the tropical landscape already may release more carbon than they store . But the inhaling and exhaling of CO2 is just one way this damp jungle , the most species - rich on Earth , influences the global climate . Activities in the Amazon , both natural and human - caused , can shift the rainforest ’s contribution in significant ways , warming the air directly or releasing other greenhouse gases that do . Drying wetlands and soil compaction from logging , for example , can increase emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide . Land - clearing fires release black carbon , small particles of soot that absorb sunlight and increase warmth . Deforestation can alter rainfall patterns , further drying and heating the forest . Regular flooding and dam - building releases the potent gas methane , as does cattle ranching , one chief reason forests are destroyed . And roughly 3.5 percent of all methane released globally comes naturally from the Amazon ’s trees . Yet no team had ever tried to assess the cumulative impact of these processes , even as the region is being rapidly transformed . The research , supported by the National Geographic Society and published today in Frontiers in Forests and Global Change , estimates that atmospheric warming from all of these sources combined now appears to swamp the forest ’s natural cooling effect . “ Cutting the forest is interfering with its carbon uptake ; that ’s a problem , ” says lead author Kristofer Covey , a professor of environmental studies at New York ’s Skidmore College . “ But when you start to look at these other factors alongside CO2 , it gets really hard to see how the net effect is n’t that the Amazon as a whole is really warming global climate . ” The damage can still be reversed , he and his colleagues say . Halting global emissions from coal , oil , and natural gas would help restore balance , but curbing Amazon deforestation is a must , along with reducing dam building and increasing efforts to replant trees . Continuing to clear land at current rates appears certain to make warming worse for the entire world . “ We have this system that we have relied on to counter our mistakes , and we have really exceeded the capacity of that system to provide reliable service , ” says co - author Fiona Soper , an assistant professor at McGill University . A complicated ledger The same richness that makes the Amazon so wonderfully biodiverse , home to tens of thousands of insects per square mile , makes understanding it extremely hard . Shimmering green leaves suck CO2 from the sky , converting it through photosynthesis into carbohydrates that end up in woody trunks and branches as trees grow . In trees and carbon - rich soils , the Amazon stores the equivalent of four or five years worth of human - made carbon emissions , up to 200 gigatons of carbon . But the Amazon is also super wet , with floodwaters rising dozens of feet a year across the forest floor . Microbes in those drenched soils make methane , which is 28 to 86 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2 . Trees act like smokestacks , channeling that methane to the atmosphere . Meanwhile , moisture from the Atlantic Ocean that falls as rain gets sucked up by plants , used for photosynthesis , and exhaled by leaves through the same pores that take up CO2 . Back in the atmosphere , it falls as rain again . Humans complicate these natural cycles not just through climate change but through logging , reservoir - building , mining , and agriculture . Deforestation in Brazil has exploded in recent years , hitting a 12 - year high in 2020 , increasing nearly 10 percent from the year before . Some of these processes draw down greenhouse gases from the atmosphere , while others cause the gases to rise , and they all influence one another . But until recently , no had attempted to understand that balance . “ It ’s this system of interacting parts , and they ’re all measured in different ways , on different time scales , by different people , ” Soper says . What ’s clear is that the forest has been changing fast and in alarming ways . Rain now falls in massive bursts more frequently than it once did , triggering record floods . Droughts come more often and , in some areas , last longer . Trees that fare better in wet places are being outcompeted by tall , drought - tolerant species . Illegally set fires are on the rise again . About 5.4 million acres burned in 2019 , an area roughly the size of New Jersey . So , in 2019 , the National Geographic Society brought Covey , Soper , and a team of other Amazon experts together to begin trying to dissect how all of these pieces fit together . They did n’t take new measurements — they looked for new ways to analyze existing data with an eye toward a comprehensive picture . Looking beyond CO2 While the results include some uncertainty , they make clear that focusing on a single metric — CO2 — simply does n’t paint an accurate picture . “ As important as carbon is in the Amazon , it ’s not the only thing that ’s going on , ” says Tom Lovejoy , a senior fellow in biodiversity with the United Nations Foundation , who has worked in the Brazilian Amazon for decades . “ The only surprise , if you can call it that , is how much more there is when you add it all up .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-coverage-of-ipcc-report-clearly-presents-conclusions-coral-davenport/,"INCHEON , South Korea — A landmark report from the United Nations ’ scientific panel on climate change paints a far more dire picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought and says that avoiding the damage requires transforming the world economy at a speed and scale that has “ no documented historic precedent . ” The report , issued on Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a group of scientists convened by the United Nations to guide world leaders , describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires , and a mass die - off of coral reefs as soon as 2040 — a period well within the lifetime of much of the global population . The report “ is quite a shock , and quite concerning , ” said Bill Hare , an author of previous I.P.C.C. reports and a physicist with Climate Analytics , a nonprofit organization . “ We were not aware of this just a few years ago . ” The report was the first to be commissioned by world leaders under the Paris agreement , the 2015 pact by nations to fight global warming . The authors found that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate , the atmosphere will warm up by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1.5 degrees Celsius ) above preindustrial levels by 2040 , inundating coastlines and intensifying droughts and poverty . Previous work had focused on estimating the damage if average temperatures were to rise by a larger number , 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ( 2 degrees Celsius ) , because that was the threshold scientists previously considered for the most severe effects of climate change . The new report , however , shows that many of those effects will come much sooner , at the 2.7 - degree mark . Avoiding the most serious damage requires transforming the world economy within just a few years , said the authors , who estimate that the damage would come at a cost of $ 54 trillion . But while they conclude that it is technically possible to achieve the rapid changes required to avoid 2.7 degrees of warming , they concede that it may be politically unlikely . [ How much hotter is your hometown today than when you were born ? Find out here . ] For instance , the report says that heavy taxes or prices on carbon dioxide emissions — perhaps as high as $ 27,000 per ton by 2100 — would be required . But such a move would be almost politically impossible in the United States , the world ’s largest economy and second - largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China . Lawmakers around the world , including in China , the European Union and California , have enacted carbon pricing programs . President Trump , who has mocked the science of human - caused climate change , has vowed to increase the burning of coal and said he intends to withdraw from the Paris agreement . And on Sunday in Brazil , the world ’s seventh - largest emitter of greenhouse gas , voters appeared on track to elect a new president , Jair Bolsonaro , who has said he also plans to withdraw from the accord . The report was written and edited by 91 scientists from 40 countries who analyzed more than 6,000 scientific studies . The Paris agreement set out to prevent warming of more than 3.6 degrees above preindustrial levels — long considered a threshold for the most severe social and economic damage from climate change . But the heads of small island nations , fearful of rising sea levels , had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming . [ What on Earth is going on ? Sign up to get our latest stories about climate change . ] Absent aggressive action , many effects once expected only several decades in the future will arrive by 2040 , and at the lower temperature , the report shows . “ It ’s telling us we need to reverse emissions trends and turn the world economy on a dime , ” said Myles Allen , an Oxford University climate scientist and an author of the report . To prevent 2.7 degrees of warming , the report said , greenhouse pollution must be reduced by 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030 , and 100 percent by 2050 . It also found that , by 2050 , use of coal as an electricity source would have to drop from nearly 40 percent today to between 1 and 7 percent . Renewable energy such as wind and solar , which make up about 20 percent of the electricity mix today , would have to increase to as much as 67 percent . “ This report makes it clear : There is no way to mitigate climate change without getting rid of coal , ” said Drew Shindell , a climate scientist at Duke University and an author of the report . The World Coal Association disputed the conclusion that stopping global warming calls for an end of coal use . In a statement , Katie Warrick , its interim chief executive , noted that forecasts from the International Energy Agency , a global analysis organization , “ continue to see a role for coal for the foreseeable future . ” Ms. Warrick said her organization intends to campaign for governments to invest in carbon capture technology . Such technology , which is currently too expensive for commercial use , could allow coal to continue to be widely used . Despite the controversial policy implications , the United States delegation joined more than 180 countries on Saturday in accepting the report ’s summary for policymakers , while walking a delicate diplomatic line . A State Department statement said that “ acceptance of this report by the panel does not imply endorsement by the United States of the specific findings or underlying contents of the report . ” The State Department delegation faced a conundrum .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-story-highlights-the-growing-number-of-extremely-hot-days-in-a-warming-world-brad-plumer-n-popovich/,"Extremely hot days , when temperatures soar to 95 degrees Fahrenheit or higher , can be miserable . Crops wilt in the fields . Electric grids strain to keep pace with demand . People are at greater risk of dying . And those hot temperatures are expected to be much more frequent in the coming decades . The map above , based on a new analysis from the Climate Impact Lab , shows how 95 - degree days ( 35 degrees Celsius ) are expected to multiply this century if countries take moderate climate action . In this scenario , countries would take some measures , but not drastic ones , to curb emissions — roughly the trajectory of the current pledges under the Paris climate agreement . The resulting global warming would still cause significant shifts for many cities . In Washington , from 1986 to 2005 , an average of seven days each year had temperatures of at least 95 degrees . By the end of the century , the city can expect 29 of these extremely hot days per year , on average . ( The likely range is 14 to 46 hot days per year . ) Phoenix is used to the heat , averaging 124 days per year with 95 - degree weather . At the end of the century , that ’s expected to increase to around 155 days — an extra month of extreme temperatures each year . Madrid would go from eight severely hot days per year to 43 , Beijing from nine to 35 . The swings are even greater closer to the equator . New Delhi , India ’s capital city , has historically averaged 105 days with temperatures of at least 95 degrees each year . That ’s likely to rise to a range of 137 to 200 days per year . Things could get worse if countries fail to take action If the world ’s nations took no action on global warming , and emissions continued to rise at the same pace they did in the first decade of this century — with total global warming of 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit or more by the end of the century — extremely hot days would become much more commonplace . Global warming if no action is taken By 2100 , Washington could swelter in 95 - degree weather for fully one - fifth of the year — around 74 days , on average . Large swaths of Brazil and sub - Saharan Africa would experience these temperatures for most of the year . This worst case for global warming now appears less likely as global coal use declines and nations slowly move toward cleaner energy . How 95 - degree days disrupt our everyday lives In the United States , electricity use soars as temperatures rise and more households use air - conditioning more frequently . One recent study found that the United States ’ electric grid would have to handle a 7.2 percent increase in peak demand this century under a moderate warming scenario . As temperature increases : The flip side is that air - conditioning can be an essential adaptation tactic . In countries without widespread cooling , heat deaths rise more sharply during the hottest days . One study estimated that heat deaths in India increase by 3.2 percent for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit above 68 ( or every 1 degree Celsius above 20 ) . Energy use in many countries may rise sharply as people struggle to adapt to a hotter climate . Other scientists have found that corn and soybean yields in the United States plummet precipitously when temperatures rise above 84 degrees Fahrenheit ( 29 degrees Celsius ) , and that worker productivity declines sharply , particularly for outdoor jobs . And researchers are trying to understand how crime and conflict might rise as temperatures increase . Ultimately , people will be better able to adapt if they have a better idea of what individual cities and regions can expect , said Trevor Houser , who co - directs the Climate Impact Lab . In the United States , some urban planners are already experimenting with techniques like adding green spaces or increasing the reflectivity of rooftops to cool down city centers during heat waves . “ Right now , when you start talking to people about higher temperatures , they tend to think , great , more beach days , ” said Solomon Hsiang , a professor of public policy at the University of California , Berkeley who helps direct the lab . “ What ’s often less appreciated is just how much an extremely hot day can distort our lives in all sorts of ways we do n’t often even think about .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/letter-signed-by-500-scientists-relies-on-inaccurate-claims-about-climate-science/,"A global network of 500 scientists and professionals has prepared this urgent message . Climate science should be less political , while climate policies should be more scientific . Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming , while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming , and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation . Natural as well as anthropogenic factors cause warming The geological archive reveals that Earth ’s climate has varied as long as the planet has existed , with natural cold and warm phases . The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850 . Therefore , it is no surprise that we now are expe riencing a period of warming . Only very few peer - reviewed papers even go so far as to say that recent warming is chiefly anthropogenic . Warming is far slower than predicted The world has warmed at less than half the originally - predicted rate , and at less than half the rate to be expected on the basis of net anthropogenic forcing and radiative imbalance . It tells us that we are far from understanding climate change . Climate policy relies on inadequate models Climate models have many shortcomings and are not remotely plausible as policy tools . Moreover , they most likely exaggerate the effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2 . In addition , they ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial . CO2 is plant food , the basis of all life on Earth CO2 is not a pollutant . It is essential to all life on Earth . Photosynthesis is a blessing . More CO2 is beneficial for nature , greening the Earth : additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass . It is also good for agriculture , increasing the yields of crops worldwide . Global warming has not increased natural disasters There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes , floods , droughts and suchlike natural disasters , or making them more frequent . However , CO2 - mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly . For instance , wind turbines kill birds and insects , and palm - oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests . Climate policy must respect scientific and economic realities There is no climate emergency . Therefore , there is no cause for panic and alarm . We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net - zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050 . If better approaches emerge , we will have ample time to reflect and adapt . The aim of international policy should be to provide reliable and affordable energy at all times , and throughout the world .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Inaccurate', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/commentary-australian-ignores-evidence-misrepresents-research-falsely-claiming-humans-not-responsible-climate-change-ian-plimer/,"You could n’t make it up if you tried . Australia is a huge exporter of energy as coal , LNG and uranium , yet it has unreliable and ­expensive electricity . South Australia has achieved a first for ­Australia : it has the most expensive electricity in the world . A short time ago it had cheap coal - fired power . Australia remains the only G20 country with no nuclear power yet has 30 per cent of the planet ’s in - ground uranium , mainly in South Australia . Vic­toria has banned drilling for ­onshore gas in its two gas - rich ­basins yet suffers a gas shortage . Australia ’s energy crisis is based on a flawed fundamental . Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions . It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming . If it were shown , it would also have to be shown that the 97 per cent of emissions from natural processes such as ocean degassing , volcanoes , natural chemical reactions and exhalation do n’t drive global warming . In the geological past , Earth ’s atmosphere had hundreds of times the CO2 content of the modern atmosphere yet there were no carbon dioxide - driven catastrophes . The past shows that climate change is normal , that warmer times and more atmospheric carbon dioxide have driven biodiversity and that cold times kill . Ice core drilling shows that 800 years after natural warming , the atmosphere increases in carbon dioxide . The zenith of the Little Ice Age was 300 years ago and since then we have slightly warmed and cooled during a long - term warming trend . Instrumental temperature measurements over the past 150 years show no correlation between human emissions of CO2 and ­temperature . On all timescales it can be shown that there is no correlation between CO2 emissions and global warming . Without correlation , there can be no causation . The worldwide temperature record has been changed . Cooling trends have been “ homogenised ” to warming trends . In the corporate world , if a loss is “ homo­genised ” to a profit , it is fraud . Why is climate science different ? No genuine environmentalist could honestly support subsidised wind turbines that despoil the scenery , slice and dice birds and bats , damage human health and spread toxins . This is not environmentalism . It is power over people by unelected activists , often ­funded from outside Australia . Unless the laws of physics are changed , solar power can not be made more efficient . Solar facilities result in the clearing and environmental degradation of huge acreages and depositing of toxins . Construction and maintenance of wind and solar facilities ­release far more carbon dioxide than they are meant to save over their working lives and they need to be sup­ported 24/7 by coal - fired generators . The Spaniards invented a way of producing solar power at night without changing the laws of physics . Diesel generators with floodlights illuminated solar ­panels . Subsidies were so generous that profits could still be made at night . No wonder Spain went broke . Australia ’s CO2 emissions are only 1.3 per cent of global human emissions , which are 3 per cent of the total global emissions . To reduce Australian emissions will have absolutely no effect on the planet ’s temperature . The only effect will be a rapid reduction in jobs as electricity prices skyrocket . Those who signed the Paris ­Accord actually believed they can twiddle the planetary dials to minimise warming to less than 2 Celsius yet seemed blissfully ­unaware that whatever humans do , they can not change Earth ’s orbit and radiation released from the sun that drive climate . Australia ’s signed a suicide note yet did n’t seem to notice that China , India , Indonesia and the US did not commit to reducing their large carbon dioxide emissions . The grasslands , crops , forests and territorial waters of Australia absorb more carbon dioxide than Australia emits . Australia should demand the Paris Accord shell out some of the billions sloshing around in the climate business . The subsidies for wind and solar power and the must - take mandate have attracted all sorts of dodgy enterprises , lickspittles and carpetbaggers to the renewable energy honey pot . The National Energy Market was the nail in the coffin and , after 40 years of falling electricity costs and a reliable grid , Australia now has energy poverty and destruction of businesses . Electricity is not a luxury ; it is a necessity for any civilised society . The solution requires political courage . Cancel the renewable energy target , large - scale RET , ­renewable energy certificates , clean energy target and any funding that subsidises renewable ­energy . Cancel funding for climate research institutes , climate conferences , carbon capture schemes and jaunts for signing suicide notes . If any energy company provides electricity to the grid , decree that it must have 90 per cent availability 24/7 and get rid of the must - take mandate . Cancel the charitable status of feral activist groups like Greenpeace . Change the Corporations Law such that green activists , environmentalists , unionists and lobbyists abide by the same conditions of probity as company directors . Because investment confidence in energy in Australia has been destroyed , governments must build modern coal - fired and nuclear power stations . Australia needs a nuclear industry that could start by using modular reactors for isolated mines and towns before growing a vertically integrated nuclear industry . Only elections can change the madness but no major political party has nation - building leaders and a coherent policy to cut electricity costs and ­increase reliability .

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/business-insider-highlights-health-impacts-climate-change-aspects-are-misleading-kevin-loria/,"The average concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth 's atmosphere topped 411 parts per million in May. In April — the previous month — the concentration hit 410 ppm for the first time in recorded history . These are the highest CO2 levels in the 800,000 years for which we have good data . This is expected to have a catastrophic effect on human health and the planet . We have a pretty good idea of what Earth 's atmosphere has looked like for the past 800,000 years . Humans like us — Homo sapiens — evolved about 200,000 years ago , but ice - core records reveal intricate details of our planet 's history from long before humans existed . By drilling more than 3 kilometers deep into the ice sheets over Greenland and Antarctica , scientists can see how temperature and atmospheric carbon - dioxide levels have changed . From that record , we know the atmosphere and the air that we breathe has never had as much carbon dioxide in it as it does today . For the first time in recorded history , the average monthly level of CO2 in the atmosphere exceeded 410 parts per million in April , according to observations at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii . In May , that number climbed above 411 ppm , according to researchers from Scripps Institute of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . The record is not a coincidence — humans have rapidly transformed the air we breathe by pumping CO2 into it over the past two centuries . In recent years , we 've pushed those gas levels into uncharted territory . That change has inevitable and scary consequences . Research indicates that if unchecked , increased CO2 levels could cause pollution - related deaths to increase by tens of thousands , and lead to the slowing of human cognition ( especially when you take into account the fact that CO2 levels tend to be higher indoors in cities ) . Carbon dioxide also contributes to warming that causes sea - level rise , searing heat waves , and superstorms . "" As a scientist , what concerns me the most is what this continued rise actually means : that we are continuing full speed ahead with an unprecedented experiment with our planet , the only home we have , "" Katharine Hayhoe , a climate scientist , said on Twitter . Breathing the air of a new world For the 800,000 years for which we have records , average global CO2 levels fluctuated between about 170 ppm and 280 ppm . Once humans started to burn fossil fuels in the industrial era , things changed rapidly . Only in the industrial era has the number risen above 300 ppm . The concentration first crept above 400 ppm in 2013 , and it continues to climb . There 's a debate among scientists about the last time CO2 levels were this high . It might have been during the Pliocene era , 2 million to 4.6 million years ago , when sea levels were 60 to 80 feet higher than today . Or it may have been in the Miocene , 10 million to 14 million years ago , when seas were more than 100 feet higher than now . In our 800,000 - year record , it took about 1,000 years for CO2 levels to increase by 35 ppm . We 're currently averaging an increase of more than 2 ppm a year , meaning we could hit an average of 500 ppm within the next 45 years . CO2 does n't directly harm human health at these concentrations . But because it traps heat on the planet that then cranks up the global thermostat , it can have a very significant effect on health . Global temperature tracks very closely to atmospheric levels of CO2 . The potential effects of higher average temperatures include tens of thousands of deaths from heat waves , more extreme weather events , and the spread of diseases carried by ticks and mosquitoes — something we 're already seeing . ( There 's a full list of possible ways climate change will affect human health on an archived Environmental Protection Agency page . ) Higher levels of CO2 and the warming they cause also exacerbate ozone pollution . One 2008 study found that for every degree Celsius the temperature rises because of CO2 levels , ozone pollution can be expected to kill an additional 22,000 people via respiratory illness , asthma , and emphysema . Humans have never had to breathe air that 's this polluted . Increased air pollution has been shown to cause lung cancer , cardiovascular disease , and higher rates of allergies and asthma . A recent study found that 9 million people died prematurely from pollution - related diseases in 2015 , accounting for 16 % of all deaths worldwide . Other research has raised even more concerns . The average CO2 level does n't represent the air most of us breathe . Cities tend to have far more CO2 than average — and those levels rise even higher indoors . Some research indicates that it may have a negative effect on human cognition and decision - making . For these reasons , President Barack Obama 's EPA ruled in 2009 that CO2 was a pollutant that needed to be regulated under the Clean Air Act . But the Trump administration is reevaluating that ruling . Drowning in CO2 The human - health effects of CO2 increases are just one part of the bigger story here . The change we 've seen in CO2 levels recently has been much more rapid than the historical trends . Some experts think we 're on track to hit 550 ppm by the end of the century , which could cause average global temperatures to rise by 6 degrees Celsius .",['Inaccurate']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/satellite-measurements-accelerating-sea-level-rise-cnn-accurately-reports-brandon-miller/,"( CNN)Sea level rise is happening now , and the rate at which it is rising is increasing every year , according to a study released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . Researchers , led by University of Colorado - Boulder professor of aerospace engineering sciences Steve Nerem , used satellite data dating to 1993 to observe the levels of the world 's oceans . Using satellite data rather than tide - gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level , since it provides measurements of the open ocean . The team observed a total rise in the ocean of 7 centimeters ( 2.8 inches ) in 25 years of data , which aligns with the generally accepted current rate of sea level rise of about 3 millimeters ( 0.1 inches ) per year . But that rate is not constant . Continuous emissions of greenhouse gases are warming the Earth 's atmosphere and oceans and melting its ice , causing the rate of sea level rise to increase . "" This acceleration , driven mainly by accelerated melting in Greenland and Antarctica , has the potential to double the total sea level rise by 2100 as compared to projections that assume a constant rate , to more than 60 centimeters instead of about 30 , "" said Nerem , who is also a fellow with the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science . That projection agrees perfectly with climate models used in the latest International Panel on Climate Change report , which show sea level rise to be between 52 and 98 centimeters by 2100 for a "" business as usual "" scenario ( in which greenhouse emissions continue without reduction ) . Therefore , scientists now have observed evidence validating climate model projections , as well as providing policy - makers with a "" data - driven assessment of sea level change that does not depend on the climate models , "" Nerem said . Sea level rise of 65 centimeters , or roughly 2 feet , would cause significant problems for coastal cities around the world . Extreme water levels , such as high tides and surges from strong storms , would be made exponentially worse . Consider the record set in Boston Harbor during January 's "" bomb cyclone "" or the inundation regularly experienced in Miami during the King tides ; these are occurring with sea levels that have risen about a foot in the past 100 years . Now , researchers say we could add another 2 feet by the end of this century . Nerem and his team took into account natural changes in sea level thanks to cycles such as El Niño / La Niña and even events such as the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo , which altered sea levels worldwide for several years . The result is a "" climate - change - driven "" acceleration : the amount the sea levels are rising because of the warming caused by manmade global warming . The researchers used data from other scientific missions such as GRACE , the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment , to determine what was causing the rate to accelerate . NASA 's GRACE mission used satellites to measure changes in ice mass . This image shows areas of Antarctica that gained or lost ice between 2002 and 2016 . Currently , over half of the observed rise is the result of "" thermal expansion "" : As ocean water warms , it expands , and sea levels rise . The rest of the rise is the result of melted ice in Greenland and Antarctica and mountain glaciers flowing into the oceans . Theirs is a troubling finding when considering the recent rapid ice loss in the ice sheets . "" Sixty - five centimeters is probably on the low end for 2100 , "" Nerem said , "" since it assumes the rate and acceleration we have seen over the last 25 years continues for the next 82 years . "" "" We are already seeing signs of ice sheet instability in Greenland and Antarctica , so if they experience rapid changes , then we would likely see more than 65 centimeters of sea level rise by 2100 . "" Penn State climate scientist Michael Mann , who was not involved with the study , said "" it confirms what we have long feared : that the sooner - than - expected ice loss from the west Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets is leading to acceleration in sea level rise sooner than was projected .",['Sound_reasoning']

The WMO ’s assessment of the climate in 2016 , published on Tuesday , reports unprecedented heat across the globe , exceptionally low ice at both poles and surging sea - level rise . Global warming is largely being driven by emissions from human activities , but a strong El Niño – a natural climate cycle – added to the heat in 2016 . The El Niño is now waning , but the extremes continue to be seen , with temperature records tumbling in the US in February and polar heatwaves pushing ice cover to new lows . “ Even without a strong El Niño in 2017 , we are seeing other remarkable changes across the planet that are challenging the limits of our understanding of the climate system . We are now in truly uncharted territory , ” said David Carlson , director of the WMO ’s world climate research programme . “ Earth is a planet in upheaval due to human - caused changes in the atmosphere , ” said Jeffrey Kargel , a glaciologist at the University of Arizona in the US . “ In general , drastically changing conditions do not help civilisation , which thrives on stability . ” The WMO report was “ startling ” , said Prof David Reay , an emissions expert at the University of Edinburgh : “ The need for concerted action on climate change has never been so stark nor the stakes so high . ” The new WMO assessment also prompted some scientists to criticise Donald Trump . “ While the data show an ever increasing impact of human activities on the climate system , the Trump administration and senior Republicans in Congress continue to bury their heads in the sand , ” said Prof Sir Robert Watson , a distinguished climate scientist at the UK ’s University of East Anglia and a former head of the UN ’s climate science panel . “ Our children and grandchildren will look back on the climate deniers and ask how they could have sacrificed the planet for the sake of cheap fossil fuel energy , when the cost of inaction exceeds the cost of a transition to a low - carbon economy , ” Watson said . Trump is aiming to cut climate change research . But the WMO ’s secretary - general Petteri Taalas said : “ Continued investment in climate research and observations is vital if our scientific knowledge is to keep pace with the rapid rate of climate change . ” 2016 saw the hottest global average among thermometer measurements stretching back to 1880 . But scientific research indicates the world was last this warm about 115,000 years ago and that the planet has not experienced such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for 4 m years . 2017 has seen temperature records continue to tumble , in the US where February was exceptionally warm , and in Australia , where prolonged and extreme heat struck many states . The consequences have been particularly stark at the poles . “ Arctic ice conditions have been tracking at record low conditions since October , persisting for six consecutive months , something not seen before in the [ four - decade ] satellite data record , ” said Prof Julienne Stroeve , at University College London in the UK . “ Over in the southern hemisphere , the sea ice also broke new record lows in the seasonal maximum and minimum extents , leading to the least amount of global sea ice ever recorded . ” Emily Shuckburgh , at the British Antarctic Survey , said : “ The Arctic may be remote , but changes that occur there directly affect us . The melting of the Greenland ice sheet is already contributing significantly to sea level rise , and new research is highlighting that the melting of Arctic sea ice can alter weather conditions across Europe , Asia and North America . ” Global sea level rise surged between November 2014 and February 2016 , with the El Niño event helping the oceans rise by 15 mm . That jump would have take five years under the steady rise seen in recent decades , as ice caps melt and oceans get warmer and expand in volume . Final data for 2016 sea level rise have yet to be published . Climate change harms people most directly by increasing the risk of extreme weather events and the WMO report states that these raised risks can increasingly be calculated . For example , the Arctic heatwaves are made tens of times more likely and the soaring temperatures seen in Australia in February were made twice as likely . “ With levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere consistently breaking new records , the influence of human activities on the climate system has become more and more evident , ” said Taalas .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-story-accurately-describes-rio-grandes-climate-context-henry-fountain/,"Mario Rosales , who farms 365 acres along the Rio Grande , knows the river is in bad shape this year . It has already dried to a dusty ribbon of sand in some parts , and most of the water that does flow is diverted to irrigate crops , including Mr. Rosales ’s fields of wheat , oats , alfalfa and New Mexico ’s beloved chiles . Because last winter ’s mountain snowpack was the second - lowest on record , even that irrigation water may run out at the end of July , three months earlier than usual . But Mr. Rosales is n’t worried . He is sure that the summer thunderstorms , known here as the monsoon , will come . “ Sooner or later , we ’ll get the water , ” he said . The monsoon rains he is counting on are notoriously unpredictable , however . So he and many of the other farmers who work 62,000 acres along 140 miles of the Rio Grande in central New Mexico may get by — or they may not . “ Nobody ’s got a whole lot of water , ” said David Gensler , the hydrologist for the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District , whose job is to manage the river water that is delivered to Mr. Rosales and the others through diversion dams , canals and ditches . “ If we use it up early in the season and do n’t get any rain further on , the whole thing ’s going to crash . ” Parts of the state got some much - needed rain this week , which may help Mr. Gensler extend his irrigation water a bit . But whatever happens this spring and summer , the long - term outlook for the river is clouded by climate change . This image , taken on May 17 , shows a stretch of the river that is expected to dry earlier than usual because of reduced water flow and diversion for irrigation . As the river dries , crews rescue endangered minnows from remaining pools of water . The Rio Grande is a classic “ feast or famine ” river , with a dry year or two typically followed by a couple of wet years that allow for recovery . If warming temperatures brought on by greenhouse gas emissions make wet years less wet and dry years even drier , as scientists anticipate , year - to - year recovery will become more difficult . “ The effect of long - term warming is to make it harder to count on snowmelt runoff in wet times , ” said David S. Gutzler , a climate scientist at the University of New Mexico . “ And it makes the dry times much harder than they used to be . ” With spring runoff about one - sixth of average and more than 90 percent of New Mexico in severe to exceptional drought , conditions here are extreme . Even in wetter years long stretches of the riverbed eventually dry as water is diverted to farmers , but this year the drying began a couple of months earlier than usual . Some people are concerned that it may dry as far as Albuquerque , 75 miles north . But the state of the Rio Grande reflects a broader trend in the West , where warming temperatures are reducing snowpack and river flows . A study last year of the Colorado River , which provides water to 40 million people and is far bigger than the Rio Grande , found that flows from 2000 to 2014 were nearly 20 percent below the 20th century average , with about a third of the reduction attributable to human - caused warming . The study suggested that if climate change continued unabated , human - induced warming could eventually reduce Colorado flows by at least an additional one - third this century . “ Both of these rivers are poster children for what climate change is doing to the Southwest , ” said Jonathan T. Overpeck , dean of the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan and an author of the Colorado study . While both the Colorado and the Rio Grande are affected by warming , Dr. Overpeck said , the Rio Grande has also been hurt by declines in winter precipitation . “ It ’s a one - two punch , ” he said . Last year , though , was a wet one on the Rio Grande , with a strong snowpack in the winter of 2016 - 17 that allowed the conservancy district to store water in upstream reservoirs . Using that water now should help Mr. Gensler keep the irrigation taps turned for several months . “ In some ways I ’m more concerned about 2019 than 2018 , ” he said . “ There ’s a possibility we ’re going to drain every drop this year , and go into next year with nothing . ” Temperatures in the Southwest increased by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit ( one degree Celsius ) from 1901 to 2010 , and some climate models forecast a total rise of six degrees or more by the end of this century . As elsewhere in the West , warmer temperatures in winter mean that more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow in the San Juan and Sangre de Cristo mountains that feed the Rio Grande . Dr. Gutzler said spring temperatures have an impact , too , with warmer air causing more snow to turn to vapor and essentially disappear . A longer and warmer growing season also has an effect , Dr. Overpeck said , as plants take up more water , further reducing stream flows . Running for nearly 1,900 miles , mostly through arid lands , the Rio Grande is one of the longest rivers in the United States . It is also one of the most managed , having been controlled by dams and other structures for most of the last century .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/ian-plimer-op-ed-in-the-australian-again-presents-long-list-of-false-claims-about-climate/,"As soon as the words carbon footprint , emissions , pollution , and decarbonisation , climate emergency , extreme weather , unprecedented and extinction are used , I know I am being conned by ignorant activ­ists , populist scaremonger­ing , vote - chasing politicians and rent seekers . Pollution by plastics , sulphur and nitrogen gases , particulates and chemicals occurs in developing countries . That ’s real pollution . The major pollution in advanced economies is the polluting of minds about the role of carbon dioxide . There are no carbon emissions . If there were , we could not see because most carbon is black . Such terms are deliberately misleading , as are many claims . But then again , we should be used to this after the hysteria about the Great Barrier Reef bleaching that has really been occurring for hundreds of years , fraudulent changing of past weather records , the ignoring of data that shows Pacific islands and the Maldives are growing rather than being inundated , and unsubstantiated claims polar ice is melting . By ignoring history and geology , any claim of unusual weather can be made sensational . We ’ve had reefs on planet Earth for 3500 million years . They came and went many times . The big killer of reefs was because sea level dropped and water temperature decreased . In the past , reefs thrived when water was warmer and there was an elevated carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere . Reef material is calcium carbonate , which contains 44 per cent carbon dioxide . Reefs need carbon dioxide ; it ’s their basic food . We are not living in a period of catastrophic climate change . The past tells us it ’s business as usual . It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming . Climate models have been around 30 years . They have all failed . Balloon and satellite measurements show a disconnect from climate model predictions . If they have failed across the past 30 years when we can compare models with measurements , there is little chance that the climate projections across the next 50 years will be more successful . Modellers assume carbon dioxide drives climate change . It does not . The role of the sun and clouds was not considered important by modellers . They are the major drivers for the climate on our planet . We emit a trace atmospheric gas called carbon dioxide at a time in planetary history of low atmospheric carbon dioxide . The geological history of the planet shows major planetary climate changes have never been driven by a trace gas . Just because we are alive today does not mean we change major planetary systems that operated for billions of years . Earth ’s climate dances to rhythms every day , every season and on far larger lunar , ocean , solar , orbital , galactic and tectonic cycles . Climate change is normal and continual . When cycles overlap , climate change can be rapid and large . Sporadic events such as supernovas and volcanic eruptions can also change climate . The main greenhouse gas is water vapour . It is the only gas in air that can evaporate , humidify and condense into clouds that precipitate rain , hail and snow . These processes involve a transfer of energy , and water vapour makes the atmosphere behave like a giant airconditioner . Carbon dioxide is a non - condensable atmospheric gas like nitrogen and oxygen . Water vapour in air varies depending on temperature and location from five times the atmospheric carbon dioxide content in deserts to more than 100 times in the tropics . Water is 12 times more effective than carbon dioxide with respect to all incoming and outgoing radiation . Earth is unevenly heated . Our spinning oblate globe is influenced by two fluids of different composition and behaviour moving chaotically against each other over the irregular solid surface of the planet . Oceans hold most of the planet ’s surface heat , not the atmosphere . Processes that occur during sunlight do not occur at night due to the prime driver of our planet ’s surface temperature : the sun . Carbon dioxide is plant food . It is neither a pollutant nor a toxin . Without carbon dioxide , all life on Earth would die . Plants convert carbon dioxide , water and sunlight during photosynthesis into sugars , cellulose , fruit , vegetables and grains , which animal life uses as food . Marine organisms also take up and use carbon dioxide . Plants need almost three times today ’s carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere to thrive . For decades horticulturalists have pumped carbon dioxide into glasshouses to increase yields . The fossil record shows that a thriving and diversification of plant and animal life occurs every time the atmosphere had a very high carbon dioxide content . In the past , warming has never been a threat to life on Earth . Why should it be now ? When there is a low atmospheric carbon dioxide content , especially during very cold times , life struggles . For the past 500 million years , the atmospheric carbon dioxide content has been decreasing and if we halved today ’s atmospheric carbon dioxide content , all life would die . This carbon dioxide has been removed into the oceans and is sequestered into coral , shells , limey sediments and muds and on the land into coals , muds , soils and vegetation . Air contains 0.04 per cent carbon dioxide . We add carbon compounds to our bodies from food and drinks and exhale carbon dioxide . The human breath contains at least 4 per cent carbon dioxide . Our bodies contain carbon compounds . If we were so passionately concerned about our carbon footprint , then the best thing to do is to expire . In our lifetime , there has been no correlation between carbon dioxide emissions and temperature .","['Misleading', 'Inaccurate', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Biased']"
