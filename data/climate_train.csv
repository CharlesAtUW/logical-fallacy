https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/climate-exaggeration-backfiring-robert-bradley-jr-forbes/,"Green activists are at war with the greatest American foe since the Axis Powers — or so they say . The latest Democratic Party platform compares the fight against global warming to World War II . Using terms such as "" battlefield , "" "" siege , "" and "" front , "" those opposed this "" war effort "" have been labeled anything from Nazis to Holocaust deniers . ( I personally have been called a sociopath by climate activist Joe Romm of the Center for American Progress , another story . ) The upcoming election has inspired dire concern . Do n’t “ vote for climate catastrophe ” warned a Washington Post editorialist . “ At this point , ” stated Michael Klare , Professor of Peace and World Security at Hampshire College , “ electing green - minded leaders , stopping climate deniers ( or ignorers ) from capturing high office , and opposing fossil -fueled ultranationalism is the only realistic path to a habitable planet . ” Desperation Backfire ? Equating the Third Reich with the free society ’s fossil - fuel reliance , and charging Republicans with climate destruction , is from the theater of the absurd . Americans care greatly about the future ; to say otherwise is to deny their very humanity . It is right and fair that critics of climate catastrophism reject calls for bigger government , tax - wise and regulation - wise . And the great middle can be excused for realizing that obsessing about climate change is avoiding a frank discussion about the here - and - now problems of budget deficits , the federal debt , school choice , entitlement reform , and so on . Perhaps there is good news in the ugliness of desperate activists who are trying to get their issue out front . Not only do polls suggest the public is unmoved at home and in abroad , serial exaggeration at this point is arguably backfiring , confirming the perils of climate exaggeration . Until civility returns , our side can ask whether the critics are acting like the Gestapo of global warming . Two can play a game that should not be played at all . No Point of No Return Global warming activists tout their commitment to evidence and reason . Yet their dismal track record seems to lead to only more drama and hyperbole , not humility and open - mindedness . Back in 2006 , Al Gore prophesied that unless the world dramatically reduced greenhouse gasses , we would hit a "" point of no return . "" And in his book review of Gore ’s book and movie from that year , An Inconvenient Truth , scientist James Hansen unequivocally stated : “ We have at most ten years — not ten years to decide upon action , but ten years to alter fundamentally the trajectory of global greenhouse emissions . ” Time is up on Gore ’s “ point of no return ” and Hansen ’s “ critical tipping point . ” But the two fathers of the global - warming movement ( Hansen and Gore got it going back in the summer of 1988 ) have nary admitted their exaggeration nor set a new timetable for effective action . Many others have followed the same scare - and - hide pattern . Rajendra Pachauri , while head of a United Nations climate panel , pleaded that without drastic action before 2012 , it would be too late to save the planet . Back in the late 1980s , the UN claimed that if global warming were not checked by 2000 , rising sea levels would wash entire counties away . Four years ago , Peter Wadhams , professor of ocean physics at the University of Cambridge , predicted “ global disaster ” from the demise of Arctic sea ice — in four years . He too , is eating crow . There is some levity in all this charade . In 2009 , then - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown predicted that the world had only 50 days to save the planet from global warming . But fifty days and years later , and the earth still spins . Science Diminished Falsified and sure - to - be - falsified exaggerations from a parade of Ph.D. scientists are ruining the reputation of science itself . Physical science has turned into profit - maximizing political science . As Judith Curry explained to Congress : In their efforts to promote their “ cause , ” the scientific establishment behind the global warming issue has been drawn into the trap of seriously understating the uncertainties associated with the climate problem . This behavior risks destroying science ’s reputation for honesty . It is this objectivity and honesty which gives science a privileged seat at the table . Without this objectivity and honesty , scientists become regarded as another lobbyist group . Can climate research get back on track ? Can the “ uncertainty monster ” in climate research , and particularly climate modeling , be acknowledged ? Can such study overcome the Malthusian bias ( change is bad ; mankind is at fault ) to achieve impartiality ? Can the federal role in climate research be scaled back to improve incentives and quality ? Optimism , Anyone ? There is good news as good science drives out bad . The discrepancy between model - predicted warming and ( lower ) real - world observations has inspired new respect for natural climate variability relative to greenhouse - gas forcing . “ Although some researchers doubted the existence of a global warming hiatus because of coverage bias , artificial inconsistency , and a change point analysis of instrumental Ts records , ” a just - published study at Nature.com ’s Scientific Reports found , “ it is now accepted that a recent warming deceleration can be clearly observed . ” Sensitivity estimates — defined as the temperature effect from the enhanced greenhouse effect — have been coming down in the peer - reviewed literature , even to the point when climate economists see a positive externality , not a negative one , from the human influence on climate . ( In technical lingo , the so - called social cost of carbon would be negative . ) Such new thinking , long overdue , would shift the mainstream to a new view of the beneficence of plentiful , affordable , reliable energy .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Derogatory', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/heres-why-its-so-frickin-hot-right-now-andrew-freedman-mashable/,"There 's something about a warm February day that reminds you that something just is n't right . It gives you that nagging feeling that maybe global warming is real after all . February 2017 has featured prolonged warm weather the likes of which many areas have not seen before , or have only experienced on rare occasions . Taken as a whole , the month - to - date in the U.S. has seen a ridiculously lopsided ratio of daily record highs to daily record lows , which is a key indicator of short - term weather variability and , over the longer term , human - caused climate change . For individual days ' worth of warm weather , you mainly have the jet stream to thank . This current of fast - moving air at about 35,000 feet above the ground has been steering a never - ending series storms into the West Coast , where California 's mountains have picked up a crazy 500 inches of snow so far , and then moved across the U.S. in a way that has cut off flow of frigid air from the Arctic . While transient weather variability is playing a key role here , the widespread record warmth across the U.S. so far this year is part of a long - term trend toward more warm temperature records versus cold ones . This February offers a vivid illustration of this trend . Through Feb. 23 , daily record highs have been blowing away daily record lows by a far greater than 100 - to-1 ratio , which , if it holds for a few more days , would itself set a record . So far this month , there have been nearly 5,000 daily record highs set or tied , compared to just 42 daily record lows . ( Although this records ratio might need an asterisk , considering the short calendar month . ) And it 's not the daily records that are most impressive , but rather the number of monthly records that are being tied or broken from the Gulf Coast all the way to the Midwest and northeastward into Canada . During the past week alone ( not including Feb. 23 ) , there were 736 daily record highs set or tied in the U.S. , compared to zero daily record lows for the same period . Even more startling is the number of record warm overnight temperatures set or tied in the past seven days , which total a whopping 940 . There were no record cold overnight low temperatures set or tied during the same period . And the monthly records , which are far harder to break than daily milestones , are astounding . According to the National Center for Environmental Information ( NCEI ) in Asheville , North Carolina , February has seen 336 monthly record highs set or tied , along with 203 records set or tied for the warmest overnight minimum temperature . In comparison , there was not a single monthly cold temperature record set or tied through Feb. 23 . These figures do not include monthly temperature records that were broken on Friday , which included 73 degrees in Boston , shattering the previous record by 3 degrees Fahrenheit . In addition , Allentown , Pennsylvania hit a remarkable 77 degrees , and Binghamton , New York reached 70 degrees Fahrenheit . Dayton , Cincinatti and Columbus Ohio each either tied or broke their monthly high temperature records on Friday as well , with numerous monthly milestones set on Thursday , too . In Albany , New York , the high temperature of 74 degrees on Thursday was the warmest temperature on record for any day during the months of December , January and February . On Wednesday , the record warmth was centered across the Midwest , where the three major cities in Wisconsin ( Milwaukee , Madison and Green Bay ) , all saw temperatures hit record highs for not just February , but for any month during meteorological winter , which encompasses the months of December , January and February . Milwaukee , for example , broke its monthly all - time record high for February when the temperature reached 71 degrees Fahrenheit , and Madison set a monthly record with a high of 68 degrees Fahrenheit . In Ottumwa , Iowa , where the ground would normally be snow - covered this time of year , the high on Wednesday was 79 degrees , which set a monthly record as well . Some cities set records for the longest stretch of February warmth they 've seen , including Kansas City , which set a seven - day February warmth record on Wednesday , according to weather.com . On Monday , Chicago had a high temperature of 70 degrees , which was only the fifth time that has happened in any February in the "" Windy City . "" ( The fourth time also came this February . ) The warm weather in the Midwest was enabled by a marked lack of snow cover and lake ice across the Great Lakes , which allowed air temperatures to soar on mild southwesterly winds for days on end . As of Feb. 22 , just 19.1 percent of the lower 48 states were snow - covered , far below average for this time of year . While cold air is staging a comeback across the Midwest , where heavy snow is predicted to fall from Nebraska into Wisconsin , much of the South and East is likely to stay milder than average for at least a few more days . The warm weather in the U.S. has n't been a freak phenomenon only occurring for the past few weeks , either . The year - to - date is averaging a record daily highs to record daily lows ratio of more than 4 - to-1 , and studies have shown that over the past several decades , human - caused global warming has increased the odds of warm temperature records so that these ratios are becoming more and more skewed . And the warmth is n't just limited to the U.S.",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/iflscience-story-florida-sea-level-rise-somewhat-unclear-generally-correct/,"It really is hard to overstate how screwed Florida is when it comes to climate change . Sea level rise has already ensured that floods are becoming common , not freak weather extremes ; it ’s guaranteeing that hurricanes and their associated storm surges are just getting that much more powerful . Despite all this evidence , however , Governors and Senators who are often climate change deniers still get voted back into power there . As a result , instead of investing in climate change prevention measures , streets in Miami are literally getting raised up off the ground to stop floodwater coming in . A new study , published in Geophysical Research Letters , suggests that even this ludicrously short - sighted measure wo n’t be enough to stop the incoming tide . Sea level rise around the globe is accelerating year - on - year , but along the Floridian coastline , it ’s rising up three to six times faster than average . A team of researchers from the University of Florida took into account a wide range of factors when it came to determining why this was happening . After all , regional sea level rise changes are very complex , and no single mechanism is solely to blame . When it comes to human influence , there are two inputs : the melting ice caps , and thermal expansion . The former is obvious – terrestrial ice that melts , falls into the sea and disintegrates causes the sea level to rise first in the region , and then globally . The latter relates to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ; the more there is , the hotter the planet ’s surface gets , and the hotter the oceans get . Warm water expands , and normally the only way to expand is upwards . When it comes to natural cycles , sea level changes take place on short timescales normally because an oceanic current , one that shifts water from place to place , has changed . El Niño , the epic and all - encompassing climatic phenomenon that takes place every 2 - 7 years , can affect these oceanic currents . This new study suggests that Florida ’s sea level rise “ hot spot ” is being caused mostly by these natural factors . A recent , particularly powerful El Niño and a sudden weakening in the atmospheric pressure over the region - thanks to a feature known as the North Atlantic Oscillation - conspired to allow water levels to rise sharply . “ The superposition of these two ocean - atmospheric processes accounts for 87 % of the variance in the spatiotemporal pattern of intradecadal sea level oscillations , ” the team note – meaning that by far , natural processes are responsible for this unusual hot spot of sea level rise . It can not be ignored , though , that human contributions to climate change are only exacerbating this further . All in all , it ’s bad news for Florida ’s near - future , which is set to be underwater faster than anyone has previously estimated . Another study revealed that , by 2100 , there will be 2 billion climate refugees – and several million of them will be migrating from Florida to places further inland . If that ’s not the future you want , it ’s probably best to vote for lawmakers who ’ll do something about it .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/breitbart-california-fires-misleads-omitting-explanation-climates-influence-joel-pollak/,"California Governor Jerry Brown blamed climate change for the California fires that have devastated the state this fall during a visit to assess the damage in Ventura County on Saturday . “ This is the new normal , ” he said , as quoted by the Orange County Register . “ We ’re facing a new reality where fires threaten peoples ’ lives , their properties , their neighborhoods and cost billions and billions of dollars . We have to have the resources to combat the fires , and also have to invest in managing our vegetation and forests and all the ways we dwell in this very wonderful place — but a place that ’s getting hotter . ” However , climate scientists are more skeptical , noting that climate change could be one of a variety of factors . A comprehensive look at the question by Southern California Public Radio — hardly a conservative outlet — found that there was considerable debate about the factors that made this year ’s fires particularly bad . One factor was high winds , whose connection to climate change is “ still up for debate . ” Another factor was the state ’s recent drought , which persisted in the part of Southern California where the Thomas fire — now in excess of 150,000 acres , with only 15 % containment — struck . ( Ironically , last winter ’s heavy rains caused brush to grow rapidly , giving fires plenty of fuel to burn . ) An important factor in the fires of the past week was that people are building homes in areas that are naturally prone to wildfires , or where naturally dry conditions mean that the kinds of building materials and vegetation that people prefer to use in cities and suburbs are a fire hazard . Brown has frequently cited climate change as the cause for natural disasters before , only to be corrected by scientists , who suggested he was guilty of “ noble - cause corruption ” — i.e. distorting science in service of a cause that many scientists support . Last year , both Brown and then - President Barack Obama falsely linked wildfires across the western United States to climate change . And last month , Brown told a conference at the Vatican that the world needed “ brain washing ” on climate change . Aside from the Thomas fire , firefighters have made significant progress in their struggle against some of the other fires burning across the region . The Skirball fire near the 405 Freeway , which brought traffic to a standstill in Los Angeles on Thursday , was at 75 percent containment as of Saturday afternoon , according to Southern California Public Radio . The Lilac fire , which killed several dozen horses on Thursday , was fully contained by Saturday evening , according to the Register . “ The Creek Fire was now 80 % contained , and the Rye Fire was 65 % contained ” as of Saturday , the Los Angeles Times reported . Officials say there have been no deaths associated with the Southern California fires .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/article-by-the-daily-caller-oversimplifies-drivers-of-wildfires-and-downplays-role-of-climate-change-chris-white/,"Former President Bill Clinton made a significant change to federal land management nearly 30 years ago that created the conditions necessary for massive wildfires to consume portions of the West Coast , according to one fire expert who predicted the problem years ago . Shortly before leaving office in 2001 , Clinton limited the ability of the United States Forest Service to thin out a dense thicket of foliage and downed trees on federal land to bring the West into a pristine state , Bob Zybach , an experienced forester with a PhD in environmental science , told the Daily Caller News Foundation . The former president ’s decision created a ticking time bomb , Zybach argues . “ If you do n’t start managing these forests , then they are going to start burning up . Thirty years later , they are still ignoring it , ” said Zybach , who spent more than 20 years as a reforestation contractor . He was referring to warnings he made years ago , telling officials that warding off prescribed burns in Oregon and California creates kindling fuelling fires . Such rules make it more difficult to deploy prescribed burns , which are controlled burns designed to cull all of the underbrush in forests to lessen the chance of massive fires , Zybach noted . Years of keeping these areas in their natural state result in dead trees and dried organic material settling on the forest floor , turning such material into matchsticks soaked in jet fuel during dry seasons , he said . Zybach ’s comments come as wildfires continue churning through parts of California , Oregon , and Washington , media reports show . Fires have killed 26 people in West Coast states since August , including 19 people in California , and have culminated in more than half - a - million people evacuating Oregon , a number representing roughly 10 % of the state ’s overall population . Roughly 100 massive fires are blazing Saturday in the West , including 12 in Idaho and nine in Montana , the National Interagency Fire Center said Saturday . All told , the wildfires have churned through more than 4.5 million acres in 12 states . ( RELATED : Wildfires , Blackouts And High Gas Prices : Californians Fight Familiar Foes Amid Pandemic ) Shortly before leaving office , Clinton introduced the Roadless Rule that restricted the use of existing roads and construction of new roads on 49 million acres of National Forest , making it difficult for officials to scan the land for the kind of kindling that fuels massive conflagrations . The move was part of the Northwest Forest Plan ( NWFP ) , a resolution adopted by Clinton in 1994 to protect forests from being over - logged . Ten years before Clinton ’s rule , the Fish and Wildlife Service placed the northern spotted owl on the Endangered Species Act , forcing the Forest Service to adopt a new policy that resulted in a greater reduction in timber harvests . The amount of timber removed from federal lands plummeted , according to data accumulated in 2015 by the Reason Foundation . An average of 10.3 billion feet of timber was removed each year from Forest Service land between 1960 and 1990 , the data show . Those numbers dropped between 1991 and 2000 and continued dropping — an average of only 2.1 billion feet of timber was removed from the land between 2000 and 2013 , according to the data . That ’s an 80 % decline . “ They ’ve gone and left hundreds of thousands of acres of burnt timber , a fire bomb waiting to happen , standing in place because the black back woodpecker prefers that habitat , ” Zybach said . “ It ’s great for lawyers , but it ’s bad for people who breathe air or work in the woods . ” “ The prescribed burns are an ancient form of management for keeping the fuels down so these events do n’t happen , ” Zybach added , referring to Native American Indians who used controlled burns to ward away pests and prevent wildfires from licking their homes . The Clinton administration ’s plan to turn forests in the West into pristine land free of human interference risked fueling “ wildfires reminiscent of the Tillamook burn , the 1910 fires and the Yellowstone fire , ” Zybach , who is based in Oregon , told Evergreen magazine in 1994 , when the NWFP came into effect . Western Oregon had one major fire above 10,000 acres between 1952 and 1987 , reports show . The Silver Complex Fire of 1987 snapped that streak after torching more than 100,000 acres in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness area , killing rare plants and trees the federal government sought to protect from human activities . Fire Experts Agree : Prescribed Burns Are Critical Overzealous fire suppression across California are helping to build up wildland fuels , which contribute to wildfires , according to Tim Ingalsbee , a fire ecologist who began a career in the 1980s as a wildland firefighter . The solution is “ to get good fire on the ground and whittle down some of that fuel load , ” he told ProPublica in August . “ It ’s just … well … it ’s horrible . Horrible to see this happening when the science is so clear and has been clear for years . I suffer from Cassandra syndrome , ” Ingalsbee said , referring to the Cassandra Syndrome , a Greek metaphor people use when they believe their valid warnings are not heeded . “ Every year I warn people : Disaster ’s coming . We got to change . And no one listens . And then it happens . ” Other experts have made similar arguments in the past . ( RELATED : Decades Of Mismanagement Turned US Forests Into ‘ Slow - Motion Time Bombs ’ ) Overgrown grasslands , forests , and woodlands contributed to California wildfires in 2017 , Sasha Berleman , a fire ecologist , told High Country News that year .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/financial-post-commentary-misrepresents-scientific-understanding-of-weather-extremes-ross-mckitrick/,"This week in Vancouver , Prime Minister Trudeau said the federal carbon tax , a key pillar in his government ’s climate policy , will help protect Canadians from extreme weather . “ Extreme weather events are extraordinarily expensive for Canadians , our communities and our economy , ” he said , citing the recent tornadoes in Ottawa and wildfires in Western Canada . “ That ’s why we need to act . ” While members of the media may nod along to such claims , the evidence paints a different story . Roger Pielke Jr. is a scientist at University of Colorado in Boulder who , up until a few years ago , did world - leading research on climate change and extreme weather . He found convincing evidence that climate change was not leading to higher rates of weather - related damages worldwide , once you correct for increasing population and wealth . He also helped convene major academic panels to survey the evidence and communicate the near - unanimous scientific consensus on this topic to policymakers . For his efforts , Pielke was subjected to a vicious , well - funded smear campaign backed by , among others , the Obama White House and leading Democratic congressmen , culminating in his decision in 2015 to quit the field . A year ago , Pielke told the story to an audience at the University of Minnesota . His presentation was recently circulated on Twitter . With so much misinformation nowadays about supposed climate emergencies , it ’s worth reviewing carefully . Pielke ’s public presentation begins with a recounting of his rise and fall in the field . As a young researcher in tropical storms and climate - related damages , he reached the pinnacle of the academic community and helped organize the so - called Hohenkammer Consensus Statement , named after the German town where 32 of the leading scientists in the field gathered in 2006 to sort out the evidence . They concluded that trends toward rising climate damages were mainly due to increased population and economic activity in the path of storms , that it was not currently possible to determine the portion of damages attributable to greenhouse gases , and that they did n’t expect that situation to change in the near future . Advertisement Article content Shortly thereafter , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) released its 2007 report , largely agreeing with the Hohenkammer Consensus , while cherry - picking one unpublished study ( and highlighting it in the Summary for Policymakers ) that suggested a link between greenhouse gases and storm - related damages . But the author of that study — who just happened to be the same IPCC lead author who injected it into the report — later admitted his claim was incorrect , and when the study was finally published , denied the connection . In 2012 , the IPCC Special Report on Extreme Weather came out and echoed the Hohenkammer Consensus , concluding that once you adjust for population growth and economic changes , there is no statistical connection between climate change and measures of weather - related damages . In 2013 Pielke testified to the United States Congress and relayed the IPCC findings . Shortly thereafter , Obama ’s science advisor John Holdren accused him of misleading Congress and launched a lengthy but ill - informed attack on Pielke , which prompted congressional Democrats to open an investigation into Pielke ’s sources of funding ( which quickly fizzled amid benign conclusions ) . Meanwhile heavily funded left - wing groups succeeded in getting him fired from a popular internet news platform . In 2015 Pielke quit the climate field . Advertisement Article content So where did the science end up ? In the second half of his talk , Pielke reviews the science as found in the most recent ( 2013 ) IPCC Assessment Report , the 2018 U.S. National Climate Assessment , and the most up - to - date scientific data and literature . Nothing substantial has changed . Globally there ’s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts , hurricanes and floods . Some regions experience more , some less and some no trend . Limitations of data and inconsistencies in patterns prevent confident claims about global trends one way or another . There ’s no trend in U.S. hurricane landfall frequency or intensity . If anything , the past 50 years has been relatively quiet . There ’s no trend in hurricane - related flooding in the U.S. Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally . Since 1965 , more parts of the U.S. have seen a decrease in flooding than have seen an increase . And from 1940 to today , flood damage as a percentage of GDP has fallen to less than 0.05 per cent per year from about 0.2 per cent . Advertisement Article content And on it goes . There ’s no trend in U.S. tornado damage ( in fact , 2012 to 2017 was below average ) . There ’s no trend in global droughts . Cold snaps in the U.S. are down but , unexpectedly , so are heatwaves . The bottom line is there ’s no solid connection between climate change and many major indicators of extreme weather that politicians keep talking about , such as hurricanes , tornadoes , droughts , rainfall and floods , despite Trudeau ’s claims to the contrary . The continual claim of such links is misinformation employed for political and rhetorical purposes . Powerful people get away with it because so few people know what the numbers show . Many scientists who know better remain silent . And the few who push back against the propaganda , such as Roger Pielke Jr. , find themselves on the receiving end of abuse and career - threatening attacks , even though they have all the science in their corner .

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/climate-context-for-a-wet-winter-in-drought-stricken-california-in-the-la-times-rong-gong-lin-ii-paige-st-john-los-angeles-times/,"Reporting from Soda Springs , Calif. — California ’s climate has long been dominated by cycles of intense dry conditions followed by heavy rain and snow . But never before in recorded history has the state seen such an extreme drought - to - deluge swing . Experts and state water officials say California is seeing more of these intense weather swings as temperatures warm , which has profound implications for the droughts and floods the state may face in the generations to come . By Wednesday or Thursday , a new series of late - season storms is expected to vault this winter into the history books , making this year the wettest winter for California ’s northern Sierra Nevada in nearly a century of record - keeping . This is significant because the mountain range supplies large amounts of water for the rest of the state . The expected milestone is all the more remarkable given that just two years before , the state was experiencing record dry conditions . “ We went from a driest - on - record scenario to a wettest - on - record scenario , ” said David Rizzardo , chief of the snow survey section at the California Department of Water Resources . Drought - to - deluge cycle The extreme cycles of dry and wet weather appear to have been intensifying over the last three decades . “ When you look at the other five wettest years other than this one , the earliest of those is 1982 , ” Rizzardo said . “ When you look at the snowpack , the three driest years on record are 2015 , 1991 , and 1977 . ” The shift has coincided with increases in California temperatures that scientists say began about 1980 . “ The dry periods are drier and the wet periods are wetter , ” said Jeffrey Mount , a water expert and senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California . “ That is consistent with what the climate simulations are suggesting would be a consequence for California under a warming planet . ” Warming global temperatures can have a profound effect on weather patterns across the planet . Changing the distribution of warmth in the ocean drives changes in the atmosphere , which ultimately decides how much precipitation gets to California , Mount said . Warm weather worsened the most recent five - year drought , which included the driest four - year period on record in terms of statewide precipitation . California ’s first- , second- and third - hottest years on record , in terms of statewide average temperatures , were 2014 , 2015 and 2016 . And it ’s no coincidence that California ’s extreme water supply woes coincided with hot weather . Warm temperatures in 2015 made the precipitation that did fall drop as rain instead of snow . Some rain that fell in the early part of that winter had to be flushed out to sea to keep space available in reservoirs just in case flooding came later . By spring 2015 , the Sierra and Cascades produced a dubious historical record — the smallest snowpack on record , just 5 % of average . And this winter ’s near disaster at the overflowing Lake Oroville was in part caused by warm storms too . Exceptional water flows into the state ’s second - largest reservoir came not only from a constant stream of “ atmospheric river ” storms that happened to strike California but also because so much precipitation was coming down as warmer rain . Colder snow would not have posed an immediate flood risk . California water officials have been discussing how warming will affect the state ’s water system . Now some officials believe they will have to change the infrastructure — such as building or raising dams and constructing two giant tunnels underneath the confluence of the state ’s two largest rivers — to deal with more precipitation falling as rain and snow melting more quickly . Not everyone is convinced that the evidence is in that climate change is responsible for extreme swings between drought and deluge . After all , humans have only been recording rainfall and the snowpack for a relatively short period of time in California . “ I think the evidence is not very conclusive . But this surely bears watching over the coming years , ” said Dan Cayan of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego . “ Whether this is occurring because of climate change or because we ’re unlucky kind of does n’t matter , because we have to deal with it either way , ” said Jay Lund , director for the Center for Watershed Sciences at UC Davis . In Sierras , a winter that wo n’t end Two years ago , the lack of snow left locals in Soda Springs and many other parts of the Sierra stunned and anxious . The drought hurt ski resorts and changed the landscape of the Sierras . In some areas , trees died at an alarming rate . In others , the typically snow - capped mountains were bare and dry . This winter , however , many residents say they ’ve never seen so much snow . As of Tuesday , an astonishing 87.7 inches of precipitation across a zone of eight stations in the northern Sierra has been recorded since October . That ’s just shy of the 88.5 inches recorded by the conclusion of the 1982 - 83 rain year . “ There ’s just been too many road closures , too many power outages , and just too much snow and nowhere to put it , ” said Janet Tuttle , who with her husband owns Donner Ski Ranch , one of the oldest ski resorts in the state . She had a better season financially in the very ordinary weather of last year . Kelley Bernard , 37 , did n’t spend the winter here by choice . She was reassigned by the U.S. Postal Service a year and a half ago to singlehandedly staff the Soda Springs - Norden office where some 500 mountaintop residents collect their mail .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/western-journal-op-ed-deceives-readers-with-completely-unsupported-claims-jay-lehr-tom-harris/,"The idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth is among the most egregious manipulations of data in the absurd global warming debate . Americans receive a daily barrage from the fake news media and climate “ experts ” reporting that each and every day , week , month or year is the hottest on record due to global warming . On Feb. 7 , several major newspapers carried stories of the declaration by NASA and NOAA that the past five years have been the warmest on record . Sadly , these supposed experts use mathematical equations that do not jive with reality over the past 140 years . The same climate experts warn that record heat is just the tip of the iceberg . We are constantly told that global warming is the root cause behind any and all weather events that are extreme , destructive , unusual or uncomfortable . Many of these fear mongers also say we should stop burning fossil fuels that are causing this mayhem . Is the Earth truly experiencing the hottest weather on record ? Absolutely not . After examining actual weather records over the past 100 years , there is no correlation between rising carbon dioxide levels and local temperatures . However , climate change alarmists always find somewhere on Earth where temperatures are hotter than ever . The focus is always on isolated temperatures that have reached all - time highs while ignoring reports of all - time record lows . These zealots would like you to believe that due to fossil fuel emissions , summers are now longer and hotter while winters are shorter and milder . Yet , the actual temperature records tell a very different story . Did the Earth experience its hottest temperature ever this year ? The answer is no . The highest record temperature ever reported was 136 degrees Fahrenheit in Libya in 1922 . The record high temperature for the United States was 134 degrees Fahrenheit in Death Valley , California in 1913 . Fossil fuel emissions in 1913 and 1922 were negligible compared to today . The coldest temperature ever reported was minus 129 degrees Fahrenheit in Vostok , Antarctica , in 1983 when Carbon dioxide emissions were five times higher than in 1913 . The coldest temperature in the lower 48 states ( excluding Alaska ) of minus 64 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded in 1996 in Embarrass , Minnesota . Did the media and climate scientists warn that this low temperature indicated that we are headed for another Ice Age ? The maximum reported difference between high and low temperatures at a single location is 188 degrees Fahrenheit ( from minus 90F to plus 98F ) in Verhoyansk , Siberia . In fact , record changes of highs and lows have occurred in 22 U.S. cities on a single day . For example , in 1989 the temperature in Alamosa , Colorado , varied between a low of 35F and a high of 91F for a temperature swing of 56 degrees F. We hope these examples , right out of the weather record books , compiled by C.C. Burt in his book Extreme Weather Changes , will help you to understand the scams alarmists are trying to pull . These examples all illustrate that cherry - picking record high temperatures in isolated locations tells absolutely nothing about the Earth ’s climate . The strongest heat wave ever recorded occurred in July 1936 , generating high temperatures in half of America ’s 50 states . In 1935 , fossil fuel emissions were 25 times lower than today . America ’s coldest year occurred in 1899 , when temperatures dropped below 0 F in all 50 states . Clipboard Interesting that the figure above shows the most severe historic cold wave during the past century took place in 1936 , which was the same year when the strongest heat wave took place . In terms of general behavior , the global warming alarmist prediction is that as time progresses and fossil fuel emissions increase , the number of record highs should increase and record lows should decrease . However , these trends do not exist and the data dispels , rather than supports , the global warming hypothesis . Concurrently a compilation of all days since 1915 when temperatures exceeded 90F shows them decreasing with time rather than increasing in Figure 2 . Clipboard03 The heat waves experienced in the 1930s and 1950s are clearly evident here . Once again , the data does not support the claim that the United States is hotter than ever as a result of rising Carbon dioxide levels . From 1970 until 1998 there was a warming period that raised temperatures by about 0.7 F that helped spawn the global warming alarmist movement . However , since 1998 , little warming has occurred while carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase . This is totally consistent with variations in the amount of heat the Earth receives from the Sun . These facts are completely supported by 4,000 ocean floats which measure ocean temperatures at a variety of depths . This data at argo.ucsd.edu measures the oceans where climate - induced temperatures occur . Is n’t it time to start ignoring the calamitous annual claims that this is the hottest year on record ? It just ai n’t so . Jay Lehr ( jlehr@heartland.org ) is director of science at The Heartland Institute . Tom Harris ( tom.harris@climatescienceinternational.net ) is executive director of the International Climate Science Coalition ) .

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/analysis-of-chris-mooney-scientists-say-human-greenhouse-gas-emissions-have-canceled-the-next-ice-age/,"At a time of intense planetary warming , it ’s odd to even contemplate a counterfactual world in which we might instead be in or heading into a glacial period , sometimes more popularly called an “ ice age . ” But new research published Wednesday in the influential journal Nature suggests that we may have had a close scrape with such a period earlier in the current geological epoch known as the Holocene — and that pre - industrial human modifications of the climate through agriculture , fires and deforestation might have just barely staved it off . “ Humanity narrowly escaped a glacial inception in the middle of the Holocene , which was almost suppressing the formation of civilization , ” says Hans Joachim Schellnhuber , one of the paper ’s three authors and founding director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research ( the other authors are also affiliated with the institute ) . Moreover , the study says , massive human greenhouse gas emissions since that time have likely “ postponed ” what might otherwise be another ice age “ by at least 100,000 years . ” The new research is based on the idea that there are two key factors that shape whether the Earth goes into an ice age ( or glacial period ) or not . There ’s one that humans can influence , as well as one they really ca n’t . The factor out of our control is the Earth ’s Milankovitch cycles , which describe the erratic way in which the planet orbits the sun and spins on its axis over vast time periods . The Earth ’s orbit grows slowly more and less elliptical , even as the angle of the planet ’s axial tilt , and the wobble of the poles as the planet spins ( much like what you see with a spinning top ) , also change slightly over thousands of years . All of this can affect the delivery of sunlight over different parts of the Earth and the nature of the seasons — for instance , causing summers to be colder — and thus , whether it ’s possible to build up huge ice masses on land . Critically , how much sun the Earth ’s northern hemisphere high latitudes receive in summer shapes whether ice can build up there over long periods , the new study says . But there ’s also a second factor that ’s in our control — how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere . We are able to turn this knob by how many forests we cut down and how many fossil fuels we burn , both processes that transfer carbon from the land ( or beneath it ) into the atmosphere . Atmospheric carbon dioxide traps heat and so causes an overall warming effect , and this will happen no matter where the planet is in its various orbital cycles . And if there ’s enough of it , it can counteract the tendency of these cycles to make and then unmake ice ages . “ We wanted to understand what is really triggering glacial inception , and what we found is an amazingly simple function , which is the ratio between insolation around 65 north latitude and the CO2 content of the atmosphere , ” Schellnhuber said . “ And this is more or less summarizing the two key factors in the development of glacial cycles over the last at least 800,000 years . ” Specifically , using analysis of past planetary glaciations and a computer model of the Earth that is able to predict their occurrence , the researchers found that carbon dioxide concentrations were only slightly too high to push us into glaciation a few thousand years ago . Instead , we enjoyed the relatively friendly ( for humans ) interglacial climate of the Holocene . “ The Earth system would already be well on the way towards a new glacial state if the pre - industrial CO2 level had been merely 40 [ parts per million ] lower than it was during the late Holocene , ” the authors write . Indeed , they note that about 800,000 years ago , orbital alignments were similar but carbon dioxide concentrations were around 240 parts per million , and glaciation did indeed occur . It ’s important to note that at present , the Earth is not fully deglaciated — we still have major ice sheets atop Greenland and especially Antarctica . However , in a period of glacial maximum , ice sheets would also cover northern Europe and much of North America , placing vastly more total ice atop land and thus leading to sea levels radically lower than they are at present . A key question raised by the research then becomes why carbon dioxide concentrations were higher during the Holocene — the current geological epoch that began 11,700 years ago , unless you agree with some scientists that we ’ve now entered the “ Anthropocene ” — and whether this is natural . Here , the authors walk up to , but do not fully embrace , the idea that humans substantially altered the climate long before the industrial revolution , and specifically , that they upped atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations from around 240 parts per million to 280 parts per million through deforestation , agriculture and other means . This idea is credited to University of Virginia climate scientist William Ruddiman , who was not involved with the current paper . Asked to comment on it , Ruddiman agreed with the work overall but questioned why the authors did n’t more fully embrace his thesis ( which they call “ debatable ” ) , and the idea that pre - industrial humans headed off a coming ice age through their alterations of the planet ’s land surface , even without mass burning of fossil fuels ( yet ) .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/atlantic-climate-implications-reduced-beef-consumption-provide-clearer-context-james-hamblin/,"Ecoanxiety is an emerging condition . Named in 2011 , the American Psychological Association recently described it as the dread and helplessness that come with “ watching the slow and seemingly irrevocable impacts of climate change unfold , and worrying about the future for oneself , children , and later generations . ” It ’s not a formal diagnosis . Anxiety is traditionally defined by an outsized stress response to a given stimulus . In this case , the stimulus is real , as are the deleterious effects of stress on the body . This sort of disposition toward ecological - based distress does not pair well with a president who has denied the reality of the basis for this anxiety . Donald Trump has called climate change a fabrication on the part of “ the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non - competitive . ” He has also led the United States to become the only G20 country that will not honor the Paris Climate Accord , and who has appointed fossil - fuel advocates to lead the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency . For people who experience climate - related anxiety , this all serves as a sort of exacerbation by presidential gaslight . The remedy for a condition like this is knowing what can be done to mitigate environmental degradation , from within in a country singularly committed to it . RECOMMENDED READING To Save the World , Eat Bugs CAYTE BOSLER Beyond ‘ Vegetarian ’ BRIAN KATEMAN Will We Ever Stop Eating Animal Meat ? DEREK THOMPSON Like what ? Helen Harwatt is a researcher trained in environmental nutrition , a field focused on developing food systems that balance human health and sustainability . She ’s interested in policy , but realistic about how much progress can be expected under the aforementioned leadership . So she and colleagues have done research on maximizing the impacts of individuals . As with so many things in life and health , that tends to come down to food . Recently Harwatt and a team of scientists from Oregon State University , Bard College , and Loma Linda University calculated just what would happen if every American made one dietary change : substituting beans for beef . They found that if everyone were willing and able to do that — hypothetically — the U.S. could still come close to meeting its 2020 greenhouse - gas emission goals , pledged by President Barack Obama in 2009 . That is , even if nothing about our energy infrastructure or transportation system changed — and even if people kept eating chicken and pork and eggs and cheese — this one dietary change could achieve somewhere between 46 and 74 percent of the reductions needed to meet the target . “ I think there ’s genuinely a lack of awareness about how much impact this sort of change can have , ” Harwatt told me . There have been analyses in the past about the environmental impacts of veganism and vegetarianism , but this study is novel for the idea that a person ’s dedication to the cause does n’t have to be complete in order to matter . A relatively small , single - food substitution could be the most powerful change a person makes in terms of their lifetime environmental impact — more so than downsizing one ’s car , or being vigilant about turning off light bulbs , and certainly more than quitting showering . To understand why the climate impact of beef alone is so large , note that the image at the top of this story is a sea of soybeans in a silo in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest . The beans belong to a feed lot that holds 38,000 cattle , the growth and fattening of which means dispensing 900 metric tons of feed every day . Which is to say that these beans will be eaten by cows , and the cows will convert the beans to meat , and the humans will eat the meat . In the process , the cows will emit much greenhouse gas , and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat , meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people . This inefficient process happens on a massive scale . Brazil , the world ’s largest exporter of red meat , holds around 212 million cattle . ( In June , the U.S. temporarily suspended imports of beef from Brazil due to abscesses , collections of pus , in the meat . ) According to the United Nations , 33 percent of arable land on Earth is used to grow feed for livestock . Even more , 26 percent of the ice - free terrestrial surface of Earth is used for grazing livestock . In all , almost a third of the land on Earth is used to produce meat and animal products . This means much less deforestation and land degradation if so many plant crops were n’t run through the digestive tracts of cattle . If Americans traded their beef for beans , the researchers found , that would free up 42 percent of U.S. crop land . “ The real beauty of this kind of thing is that climate impact does n’t have to be policy - driven , ” said Harwatt . “ It can just be a positive , empowering thing for consumers to see that they can make a significant impact by doing something as simple as eating beans instead of beef . ” She and her colleagues conclude in the journal Climatic Change : “ While not currently recognized as a climate policy option , the ‘ beans for beef ’ scenario offers significant climate change mitigation and other environmental benefits , illustrating the high potential of animal to plant food shifts . ” The beans for beef scenario is , it seems , upon us .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/telegraph-article-misleads-with-false-balance-mixing-in-unsupported-and-inaccurate-claims-sarah-knapton/,"The impact of humans on Earth is unparalleled , with scientists arguing our actions have tipped the planet into a new era - the Anthropocene - with fallout from nuclear bombs now written into the rocks beneath our feet , and species facing extinction at 1,000 times the usual rate . Yet global warming could turn out to be the most devastating consequence of human progress . If temperatures continue to increase , experts forecast catastrophic sea level rises , a surge in hurricanes and cyclones , the spread of lethal disease , drought , famine and deadly heatwaves . But does the science back up these claims ? Is carbon dioxide primarily to blame or could there be other causes ? What role do the Sun , clouds and the oceans play ? And , can today ’s climate models be trusted when scientists have misrepresented the data in the past ? Here is what we know : Global temperature rise Earth ’s climate has changed continually throughout its 4.5 billion year history , cycling through periods of cooling and warming , of glacial advance and retreat . The last ice age ended around 11,700 years ago , ushering in a new temperate interglacial period - known as the Holocene - and triggering the birth of agriculture and the rise of civilisation . Reliable surface temperature records have been available since around the 1850s , and it is now accepted that Earth is , indeed , warming . The planet 's average ground temperature has risen by around 1.62F ( 0.9C ) during that period , with most of the warming occurring in the past 35 years . Since 1990 , global temperatures have risen between 0.23F ( 0.13C ) and 0.34F ( 0.19C ) per decade , depending on which official data set is used . Globally , the five warmest years on record have all occurred since 2010 and , in Britain , the hottest 10 years since Met Office records began in 1884 have all happened since 2002 . None of the 10 coldest years have occurred since 1963 . However the warming trend is slower than most climate models have forecast . In 1990 the United Nation 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) predicted that temperatures would rise by 0.54F ( 0.3C ) per decade . Skeptics argue that the forecasts were too high because they relied too heavily on the impact of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) . CO2 has indeed increased in the atmosphere , from approximately 0.03 per cent to 0.04 per cent ( or 400 parts per million , ppm ) over the past 50 years . And isotope measurements have shown that this rise is due to the burning of fossil fuels . Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas , absorbing and emitting certain frequencies of infrared radiation so it is generally accepted that man - made emissions must be having some kind of impact on global warming . Yet , some scientists argue that the gas is not capable of producing the extreme temperature rises seen in recent decades . In its 5th assessment report in 2013 , the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010 . But it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere . The greenhouse effect At its heart , climate change is about electromagnetic radiation coming from the Sun . To warm up , the Earth must be trapping more energy than it is leaking back into space . In the 1820s , the French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier realised that the ‘ greenhouse effect ’ must exist , otherwise our planet would be mainly frozen . As early as 1856 , Eunice Foote theorised that changing the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would alter the planet ’s temperature . In a paper titled ‘ Circumstances affecting the heat of the Sun ’s rays ’ , she outlined the thermal blanket effect of CO2 . Just five years later , John Tyndall , the Irish physicist , directly measured the warming effect of CO2 , water vapour and other gases and in 1896 , the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius calculated that the Earth ’s temperature would rise by several degrees if all the known coal in the world was burned . By 1938 , the English steam engineer and inventor Guy Callendar suggested that rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere had already caused the Earth to warm and in the 1960s US scholar Roger Revelle compiled the first series of measurements showing that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were rising . Even ExxonMobil ’s own scientists predicted in 1982 that the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and warming we would see by now if we the world did not curtail fossil fuel burning . The gases in our atmosphere keep Earth nearly 60F ( 30C ) warmer than it would be without an atmosphere . Based on our proximity to the Sun , the planet 's surface should be at -0.4F ( -18C ) but instead its a balmy 59F ( 15C ) . Dr Ed Hawkins , Professor of Climate Science , at the University of Reading , said : “ Greenhouse gases act as a blanket by making it harder for the heat to leave . The more blankets you add the warmer you get . ” However , some experts argue that carbon dioxide is only a minor player in this atmospheric hothouse effect . Ice cores from Antarctica show that at the end of recent ice ages , the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise only after temperatures began to climb . Added to that , CO2 is only one of several greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . There is also methane , nitrous oxide , hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride . But by far the largest greenhouse gas is water vapour , which makes 95 per cent of the total .","['Inappropriate_sources', 'Inaccurate', 'Misleading', 'Cherry-picking', 'Flawed_reasoning']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-accurately-covers-2017-record-low-arctic-winter-sea-ice-extent-henry-fountain/,"After a season that saw temperatures soar at the North Pole , the Arctic has less sea ice at winter ’s end than ever before in nearly four decades of satellite measurements . The extent of ice cover — a record low for the third straight year — is another indicator of the effects of global warming on the Arctic , a region that is among the hardest hit by climate change , scientists said . “ This is just another exclamation point on the overall loss of Arctic sea ice coverage that we ’ve been seeing , ” said Mark Serreze , the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center , a government - backed research agency in Boulder , Colo. “ We ’re heading for summers with no sea ice coverage at all . ” Dr. Serreze said that such a situation , which would leave nothing but open ocean in summer until fall freeze - up begins , could occur by 2030 , although many scientists say it may not happen for a decade or two after that . The melting of sea ice does not raise sea levels , but loss of ice coverage can disrupt ecosystems . For example , it can affect the timing of blooms of phytoplankton , the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain . Less ice coverage also means that there is more dark ocean to absorb more of the sun ’s energy , which leads to more warming and melting in a feedback loop called Arctic amplification . The data center said on Wednesday that sea ice in the Arctic had reached maximum extent , of about 5.5 million square miles , on March 7 . That is an area nearly twice the size of Australia , but about 470,000 square miles less than the average maximum from 1981 to 2010 . Much of the ice also appears to be thinner than normal , Dr. Serreze said , another result of the unusually warm temperatures in the Arctic this winter . Late last fall , parts of the Arctic were more than 35 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than observed averages , and at the pole itself , mean temperatures for November were 23 degrees above normal . There were similar temperature spikes in December and this year . “ The Arctic Ocean was extremely warm over the winter , and there was a very impressive series of heat waves , ” Dr. Serreze said . “ I ’ve never seen anything like this before . ” Less coverage and thinner ice mean that this summer ’s minimum , which is expected to occur in September , is likely to be low . But there is no direct link between the maximum in March and the minimum after the melting season , said Walt Meier , a research scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory . “ Just because it ’s a record low maximum , there ’s no prediction it will be a record low minimum in September , ” Dr. Meier said . “ But while a lot can happen in the summer , when you start out at such a low level , you ’re not going to get a very high minimum . ” Dr. Meier said that in addition to the low overall ice extent , some parts of the Arctic were almost completely devoid of ice this winter , including the Barents Sea off Norway and Russia . “ We have n’t seen much there at all , ” he said , “ and what there is will melt very quickly .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/bloomberg-accurately-describes-rapidly-changing-arctic-eric-roston-blacki-migliozzi/,"Eight countries control land in the Arctic Circle . Five have coastlines to defend . The temperature is rising . The ice is melting . The race for newly accessible resources is beginning . And Russia is gaining ground . The story of the Arctic begins with temperature but it ’s so much more — this is a tale about oil and economics , about humanity and science , about politics and borders and the emerging risk of an emboldened and growing Russian empire . The world as a whole has warmed about 0.9 degrees Celsius ( 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) since 1880 . Arctic temperatures have risen twice that amount during the same time period . The most recent year analyzed , October 2015 to September 2016 , was 3.5C warmer than the early 1900s , according to the 2016 Arctic Report Card . Northern Canada , Svalbard , Norway and Russia ’s Kara Sea reached an astounding 14C ( 25F ) higher than normal last fall . Scientists refer to these dramatic physical changes as “ Arctic amplification , ” or positive feedback loops . It ’s a little bit like compound interest . A small change snowballs , and Arctic conditions become much less Arctic , much more quickly . “ After studying the Arctic and its climate for three - and - a - half decades , ” Mark Serreze , director of the National Snow and Ice Data center , wrote recently . “ I have concluded that what has happened over the last year goes beyond even the extreme . ” The heat is making quick work of its natural prey : ice . Scientists track the number of “ freezing - degree days , ” a running seasonal tally of the amount of time it ’s been cold enough for water to freeze . The 2016 - 2017 winter season has seen a dramatic shortfall in coldness — more than 20 percent below the average , a record . Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated . Last month set a new low for March , out - melting 2015 by 23,000 square miles . Compared with the 1981 - 2010 baseline , the average September sea - ice minimum has been dropping by more than 13 percent per decade . A recent study in Nature Climate Change estimated that from 30 - 50 percent of sea ice loss is due to climate variability , while the rest occurs because of human activity . Receding ice decreases the Earth ’s overall reflectivity , making the Arctic darker and therefore absorbing even more heat . The ice is not all the same age or thickness , although it has become somewhat more uniform . In 1985 , about 45 percent of Arctic sea ice was made up of older and thicker multi - year ice . By 2016 , that number shrank to 22 percent . With a greater percentage of seasonal ice , which disappears each Arctic summer , nations of the north have more time and opportunity to explore the resources beneath and within their territorial waters . The sea - ice loss is President Vladimir Putin ’s gain . Already the largest country on the planet , Russia stands to gain access to shipping routes and energy reserves , and a strategic military advantage from the opening of the Arctic . Along the Russian coastline , which makes up more than half the Arctic total , winds and currents push old ice away from potential shipping lanes and prevent the build - up of thicker , multi - year ice that would leave other parts of the Arctic impassable for longer periods . That dynamic helps bring the Northern Sea Route — shippers ’ hoped - for Russian express between Western Europe and East Asia — closer to fruition . Sea ice , by definition , is already in the water and therefore does n't add to rising ocean levels as it dissolves . The same logic does not apply to Greenland ’s melting glaciers and ice sheets . Last year , Greenland saw the second - largest melt on record . The hot season lasted a troubling 30 to 40 days longer than usual in the northeast portion of the region . There 's enough water locked up in Greenland ’s ice sheet to raise seas worldwide by 20 feet . While it may take centuries to fully melt , scientists are concerned that we have a limited time to act to prevent the climate from locking in the ice sheet ’s demise . Life in the Arctic is changing along with the climate . “ Green ice ” has appeared in recent years . Named for its distinctive hue , this ice is so thin that sunlight shines through , allowing phytoplankton to thrive . Vegetation growth in parts of Canadian and Russian Arctic waters has boomed to from 5 and 19 percent above the 2003 - 2015 average , according to NOAA . What the change means for delicate ecosystems and fish stocks is the subject of increasing research attention . In a presentation in November , Johan Rockström , environmental scientist and director of the Stockholm Resilience Center , reached for scientific euphemism to make manageable the enormous scale of these interlocking changes — and who needs to be thinking about them : “ Canada , Russia and parts of the U.S. seem to be the Arctic nations subject to the largest , let ’s say , set of diverse regime - shift risks . "" In the long run , every part of the Arctic food web may have to adjust to the warming atmosphere ’s byproduct : altered ocean chemistry . Oceans do humanity a huge favor by absorbing some atmospheric carbon dioxide . However , when CO2 dissolves into water , it becomes a weak acid that , as it accumulates , may strain ecosystems that have evolved for today ’s slightly alkaline waters . The change is happening globally , but cold water “ acidifies ” more quickly than warmer seas . Arctic land stores about twice as much carbon as the atmosphere .",['Sound_reasoning']

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/great-barrier-reef-australia-coral-die-off-doyle-rice-usa-today/,"One of the world ’s treasures , the Great Barrier Reef , just suffered from its worst coral die - off ever recorded , Australian scientists announced Monday . Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man - made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die - off . "" The coral was cooked , ” Terry Hughes , director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies , told the BBC . At more than 1,400 miles long , Australia 's Great Barrier Reef is the world 's largest coral reef and the planet 's biggest structure made by living organisms . In the northernmost section of the reef , which had been considered the most "" pristine , "" some 67 % of the coral died . The good news , scientists said , was that central and southern sections of the reef fared far better , with "" only "" 6 % and 1 % of the coral dead , respectively . Coral reefs result from the work of little polyps , creatures only a few millimeters long , budded on top of one another . Over centuries , the shells of these creatures combine to form the exotic shapes of coral reefs . Tiny differences in the anatomy of each polyp species affect the shape of their shells and produce the exotic shapes of each reef . The vibrant colors that draw thousands of tourists to the Great Barrier Reef each year come from algae that live in the corals tissue . When water temperatures become too high , coral becomes stressed and expels the algae , which leave the coral a bleached white color . Mass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up . Besides their beauty , reefs shelter land from storms , and are also a habitat for myriads of species . "" Coral reefs are therefore the most biologically diverse ecosystems of the planet , and provide a number of ecosystem services that hundreds of millions of people rely on , "" said Greg Torda , also of the Centre , in an e - mail to USA TODAY . "" These include provisioning ( fishing , other types of harvesting , for pharmaceuticals , for example ) , coastal protection , aesthetic and cultural values – to name a few .

"" Tourism on the Great Barrier Reef employs 70,000 people , and generates $ 5 billion ( Australian ) in income each year , the Centre said in a statement . The good news is that much of the coral survived this bleaching event .

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/2017-track-among-hottest-year-recorded-scientists-not-surprised-thinkprogress-article-suggests-joe-romm/,"Normally , the hottest years on record occur when the underlying human - caused global warming trend gets a temporary boost from an El Niño ’s enhanced warming in the tropical Pacific . So it ’s been a surprise to climate scientists that 2017 has been so remarkably warm — because the last El Niño ended a year ago . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) reported Tuesday that the first half of 2017 was the second - warmest January - June on record for Earth , topped only by 2016 , which was boosted by one of the biggest El Niños on record . “ As if it was n’t shocking enough to see three consecutive record - breaking years , in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , for the first time on record , ” leading climatologist Michael Mann wrote in an email to ThinkProgress , “ we ’re now seeing near - record temperatures even in the absence of the El Nino ‘ assist ’ that the previous record year benefited from . ” NOAA climatologist Ahira Sanchez - Lugo told Climate Central , “ After the decline of the strong El Niño , I was expecting the values to drop a bit … . This year has been extremely remarkable . ” Usually we see global records in years when the short - term El Niño warming adds to the long - term global warming trend ( see chart below ) . As NOAA noted in its March report , without an El Niño , no month before March 2017 had ever exceeded the “ normal ” temperature ( the 1981–2010 average ) by a full 1.8 ° F ( 1.0 ° C ) . Global monthly temperature departures ( from 1981–2010 average ) color - coded by whether the Pacific was experiencing an El Niño ( red ) , a La Niña ( blue ) or neutral conditions ( gray ) . This matters because when a month — or six - month period — sees record high global temperatures in the absence of an El Niño , that is a sign the underlying global warming trend is stronger than ever . The latest NOAA report is “ a reminder that climate change has not , despite the insistence of climate contrarians ‘ paused ’ or even slowed down , ” Mann said . Bottom line : Human - caused global warming continues at a dangerous pace , and only human action to slash carbon pollution can stop it .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/analysis-of-matt-ridley-benny-peiser-your-complete-guide-to-the-climate-debate/,"In February President Obama said , a little carelessly , that climate change is a greater threat than terrorism . Next week he will be in Paris , a city terrorized yet again by mass murderers , for a summit with other world leaders on climate change , not terrorism . What precisely makes these world leaders so convinced that climate change is a more urgent and massive threat than the incessant rampages of Islamist violence ? It can not be what is happening to world temperatures , because they have gone up only very slowly , less than half as fast as the scientific consensus predicted in 1990 when the global - warming scare began in earnest . Even with this year ’s El Niño - boosted warmth threatening to break records , the world is barely half a degree Celsius ( 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit ) warmer than it was about 35 years ago . Also , it is increasingly clear that the planet was significantly warmer than today several times during the past 10,000 years . Nor can it be the consequences of this recent slight temperature increase that worries world leaders . On a global scale , as scientists keep confirming , there has been no increase in frequency or intensity of storms , floods or droughts , while deaths attributed to such natural disasters have never been fewer , thanks to modern technology and infrastructure . Arctic sea ice has recently melted more in summer than it used to in the 1980s , but Antarctic sea ice has increased , and Antarctica is gaining land - based ice , according to a new study by NASA scientists published in the Journal of Glaciology . Sea level continues its centuries - long slow rise — about a foot a century — with no sign of recent acceleration . Perhaps it is the predictions that worry the world leaders . Here , we are often told by journalists that the science is “ settled ” and there is no debate . But scientists disagree : They say there is great uncertainty , and they reflected this uncertainty in their fifth and latest assessment for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) . It projects that temperatures are likely to be anything from 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit ) warmer by the latter part of the century — that is , anything from mildly beneficial to significantly harmful . As for the impact of that future warming , a new study by a leading climate economist , Richard Tol of the University of Sussex , concludes that warming may well bring gains , because carbon dioxide causes crops and wild ecosystems to grow greener and more drought - resistant . In the long run , the negatives may outweigh these benefits , says Mr. Tol , but “ the impact of climate change does not significantly deviate from zero until 3.5 ° C warming .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Inaccurate']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/cnn-john-sutter-9-questions-on-rising-seas/,"CNN — You ’ve probably heard about some of the impacts of rising seas : Nearly a fifth of Bangladesh , in South Asia , could be submerged ; some low - lying islands in the Pacific may disappear ; coastal cities like Miami and New York are expected to see more floods . But exactly how and why are the seas rising ? The underlying answer , of course , is that humans are warming the planet by burning fossil fuels , cutting down forests and engaging in other activities that release heat - trapping gases into the atmosphere . Policy makers have concluded that the warming would be especially dangerous if it crosses a threshold of 2 degrees Celsius higher than Earth ’s temperature at the start of the industrial revolution . But for details on how climate change is raising the height of the ocean , I turned to CNN International meteorologist and supervising weather producer Brandon Miller . Below you ’ll find an edited transcript of our email conversation . I ’ll be exploring sea - level rise and what happens to people whose homes are flooded this month as part of CNN ’s “ 2 degrees ” series on climate change . Let me know in the comments at the bottom of this post if there are other sea - level - related questions you ’d like to see answered . And consider signing up for the “ 2 degrees ” newsletter if you ’d like to follow along . 1 . Why are sea levels rising ? Global sea level rise occurs because of two factors . The biggest reason is because of something called “ thermal expansion , ” which is simply that water expands as it warms , just like how the liquid in a thermometer expands as the temperature increases . Therefore , as global temperatures continue to rise , the oceans get warmer and they literally expand , making the level of the sea rise . The other main contributor to sea level rise is the loss of glaciers and the polar ice caps . When the glaciers and ice caps melt , that water flows into the ocean and increases its volume . 2 . Is this already happening – or is it a future thing ? Yes it is already happening , and yes it will continue to happen in the future , with the rate of sea level rise likely increasing as well . Since 1900 we have seen seas rise , on average , about 20 cm ( 8 inches ) . While ocean levels varied over the past 2,000 years , they did so much more slowly . It would have taken several hundred years to change the ocean level by the amount we have witnessed over the past century , with a bulk of that increase coming in the last 25 years . The rate of change in the past 20 years is about double the rate of change over the past 100 years , indicating that the rate of sea level rise is increasing . 3 . What will happen to sea levels if the climate warms 2 degrees ? Sea levels will certainly continue to rise if the climate warms 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.6 Fahrenheit ) . Sea level rise will not stop , even if the warming ends at 2 degrees . Instead , it will continue for many centuries due to the lag in response times of the world ’s oceans and massive ice sheets . If we look at the distant past , 120,000 years ago , when only very early humans existed , the temperature was 2 degrees warmer than it is now . Sea levels were about 5 meters ( 16 feet ) higher than they are today . Nearly 500 million people worldwide currently live below 5 meters elevation . 4 . How much are sea levels expected to rise by , say , 2100 ? According to the latest projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , a 2 degree increase in temperature by the end of this century would result in about a half a meter ( 1.5 feet ) of sea level rise . If we drastically and immediately reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses we are currently emitting , the sea level will still continue to rise as the result of the warming we have already seen , but it should be less , likely around 40 cm ( 15 inches ) . If we continue increasing greenhouse gas emissions at the current rate , the increase in sea level could be up to double that amount , or 80 cm ( 31 inches ) by 2100 . 5 . What about in the really , really long term ? One of the big questions is how much warming will it take to melt the Greenland Ice Sheet , which contains enough water to raise sea levels by 7 meters ( 23 feet ) . This is an incredibly difficult question to answer , but current research shows it is likely between 1 degree and 4 degrees warming , compared to pre - industrial averages . If 2 degrees is enough to melt the Greenland Ice Sheet , for instance , it could mean sea levels would rise much higher and faster than current projections show . A total melting of Greenland ’s ice likely would take thousands of years , though . 6 . Are lots of the Pacific islands actually going to disappear ? Likely not disappear , at least not in the short term ( through the end of this century ) , but they will be dramatically impacted . Many low - lying regions will see drastic changes to their coastal geography from beach erosion , significant infrastructure challenges from things like saltwater intrusion into the water system , and population displacement from inundation .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/alaskas-vicious-cycle-warming-tundra-spews-co2-speeding-up-warming-joe-romm-think-progress/,"The Alaskan tundra is warming so quickly it has become a net emitter of carbon dioxide ahead of schedule , a new study finds . Since CO2 is the primary heat - trapping greenhouse gas — and since the permafrost contains twice as much carbon as the atmosphere does today — this means a vicious cycle has begun that will speed up global warming . “ Because it ’s getting warmer , there ’s more CO2 coming out which means it ’s going to get warmer which means there ’s more CO2 coming out , ” explained Harvard researcher and lead author Roisin Commane . Dr. Commane told ThinkProgress that “ warming soils will emit more CO2 and this will overwhelm any CO2 uptake ” due to an increase in plantlife from “ CO2 fertilization and warmer temperatures . ” ’ The study is the first to report that a major portion of the Arctic is a net source of heat - trapping emissions . As a result , Commane warns that our current climate models need to be updated : “ We ’re seeing this much earlier than we thought we would see it . ” “ We find that Alaska , overall , was a net source of carbon to the atmosphere during 2012–2014 , ” the study concludes . Data from NOAA ’s Barrow Alaska station “ indicate that October through December emissions of CO2 from surrounding tundra increased by 73 percent since 1975 , supporting the view that rising temperatures have made Arctic ecosystems a net source of CO2 . ” The permafrost , or tundra , has been a very large carbon freezer . For a very long time , it has had a very low decomposition rate for the carbon - rich plant matter . But we ’ve been leaving the freezer door wide open and are witnessing the permafrost being transformed from a long - term carbon locker to a short - term carbon un - locker . “ This is ancient carbon , ” Dr. Commane told Alaska public radio . “ The carbon that ’s locked in the permafrost in the Arctic is thousands and millions of years old . ” Thawing permafrost can release not just CO2 , but also methane , a much stronger heat - trapping gas . While most models that include thawing permafrost look at CO2 , Russian scientists have recently discovered some 7,000 underground bubbles of permafrost - related methane in Siberia . Since methane traps heat 86 times more effectively than CO2 over a 20 - year span , these findings suggest that the effect of the thawing permafrost is even greater than first thought . Also , a 2008 study , “ Accelerated Arctic land warming and permafrost degradation during rapid sea ice loss , ” found that rapid sea ice loss — as has been experienced since the study was published — could triple the rate of Arctic warming . Meanwhile , the rapid Arctic warming that is fueling these emissions continues . On Monday , NASA reported that April 2017 was the second - hottest April on record — only April 2016 was hotter . As the map above shows , Arctic temperatures were blistering , up to 13.5 ° F ( 7.5 ° C ) above the 1951–1980 average . The longer we delay aggressive climate action , the harder it will be to stuff all the toothpaste back into the tube , and the more catastrophic climate impacts we will face . This post has been updated for clarity . Dr. Commane reached out to ThinkProgress to make clear that this process would not lead to a runaway greenhouse effect , but would exceed any increase in CO2 uptake from the increase in plant matter expected in the region due to climate change .",['Sound_reasoning']

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/hillary-clinton-boards-climate-crisis-train-nowhere-roy-spencer-forbes/,"Hillary Clinton and Al Gore spoke at Miami - Dade College on October 11 about the “ climate crisis ” that Gore has been trying to convince us about for 20 years . Just as in Gore ’s movie An Inconvenient Truth , weather disasters that have always occurred have been repurposed to support the climate change narrative , with the claim those disasters are getting worse . Meanwhile , Chapman University has released a survey of the top ten issues Americans fear the most . Guess what ? Climate change did n’t make the list . Instead , corruption of politicians was the No . 1 worry . For those who do n’t see the relationship between these two newsworthy events , let me connect the dots for you . Global warming and climate change , even if it is 100 % caused by humans , is so slow that it can not be observed by anyone in their lifetime . Hurricanes , tornadoes , floods , droughts and other natural disasters have yet to show any obvious long - term change . This means that in order for politicians to advance policy goals ( such as forcing expensive solar energy on the masses or creating a carbon tax ) , they have to turn normal weather disasters into “ evidence ” of climate change . As a climate researcher , I will agree that humans have likely contributed to a portion of recent warmth . I am not a denier of either natural or human - induced climate change . But the observed warming as monitored by satellites ( our only truly global monitoring system ) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening . Furthermore , the overall increases in such things as hurricanes and tornadoes have not materialized . Drought in the western U.S. pales in comparison to the mega - droughts tree rings tell us existed in centuries past . Lake - bottom sediments in Florida tell us that recent major hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico has been less frequent than in centuries past . Strong Sandy - type storms occur every year in all the major ocean basins … they just do n’t happen to hit major metropolitan areas . It has now , even after Hurricane Matthew , been over 4,000 days since a major hurricane ( Category 3 or stronger ) has made landfall in the U.S. Sea level rise , which was occurring long before humans could be blamed , has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years . If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10 - 14 feet , are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade ? If Hillary would have fact - checked her example of sea level rise in Norfolk , Virginia , she would have found out that the experts already know this is mostly due to the land there sinking . To the extent that the cost of weather disasters has risen over time , that is well known to be the result of modern society building more infrastructure in areas that are prone to damage from weather — which is almost everywhere . So , to keep the masses alarmed , politicians must claim that what is normal is actually abnormal — and getting worse . And , furthermore , that only they can fix it … and thereby save your children and grandchildren . And it is that “ fix ” that really sinks any current plan politicians have to address climate change . Even the modern godfather of global warming , ex - NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies director James Hansen , has admitted that the Paris climate agreement is “ a fraud really , a fake . ” This is because even if the countries of the world agree to do what they promised on climate change , and that climate change is entirely our fault , and that climate change really will ultimately get bad , the promised actions will have no measurable effect on future global temperatures . You see , many of those countries that have signed on to the Paris Agreement are n’t signing up to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . They are signing up for wealth transfers from the minority of advanced countries to the majority of poor countries . And you ca n’t even fix the problem with a new agreement . Why ? Because until we develop a practical , cost - competitive alternative to fossil fuels , it is unlikely that renewable energy will ever make up more than 15 - 20 % of global energy requirements . The amount of energy necessary for humans to do everything we do is simply too large . As that demand for energy grows , the amount of renewable energy also has to grow , just to maintain only a 15 - 20 % fraction of the total . So , until people actually experience climate change , and new energy technologies are developed , any claims by politicians that we are in a “ climate crisis ” will fall on deaf ears . And since the biggest risk to humanity is poverty , if we allow policymakers to have their way , the resulting energy poverty will indeed cause the deaths of some of our children and grandchildren .

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-examiner-op-ed-cherry-picks-data-to-mislead-readers-about-climate-models-patrick-michaels-caleb-stewart-rossiter/,"Computer models of the climate are at the heart of calls to ban the cheap , reliable energy that powers our thriving economy and promotes healthier , longer lives . For decades , these models have projected dramatic warming from small , fossil - fueled increases in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide , with catastrophic consequences . Yet , the real - world data are n’t cooperating . They show only slight warming , mostly at night and in winter . According to the United Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events , and the ongoing rise in sea level that began with the end of the ice age continues with no great increase in magnitude . The constancy of land - based records is obvious in data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Should we trust these computer models of doom ? Let ’s find out by comparing the actual temperatures since 1979 with what the 32 families of climate models used in the latest U.N. report on climate science predicted they would be . Atmospheric scientist John Christy developed a global temperature record of the lower atmosphere using highly accurate satellite soundings . NASA honored him for this achievement , and he was an author for a previous edition of the U.N. report . He told a House Science Committee hearing in March 2017 that the U.N. climate models have failed badly . Christy compared the average model projections since 1979 to the most reliable observations — those made by satellites and weather balloons over the vast tropics . The result ? In the upper levels of the lower atmosphere , the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed . Overprediction also occurred at all other levels . Christy recently concluded that , on average , the projected heating by the models is three times what has been observed . This is a critical error . Getting the tropical climate right is essential to understanding climate worldwide . Most of the atmospheric moisture originates in the tropical ocean , and the difference between surface and upper atmospheric temperature determines how much of the moisture rises into the atmosphere . That ’s important . Most of Earth ’s agriculture is dependent upon the transfer of moisture from the tropics to temperate regions . Christy is not looking at surface temperatures , as measured by thermometers at weather stations . Instead , he is looking at temperatures measured from calibrated thermistors carried by weather balloons and data from satellites . Why did n’t he simply look down here , where we all live ? Because the records of the surface temperatures have been badly compromised . Globally averaged thermometers show two periods of warming since 1900 : a half - degree from natural causes in the first half of the 20th century , before there was an increase in industrial carbon dioxide that was enough to produce it , and another half - degree in the last quarter of the century . The latest U.N. science compendium asserts that the latter half - degree is at least half manmade . But the thermometer records showed that the warming stopped from 2000 to 2014 . Until they did n’t . In two of the four global surface series , data were adjusted in two ways that wiped out the “ pause ” that had been observed . The first adjustment changed how the temperature of the ocean surface is calculated , by replacing satellite data with drifting buoys and temperatures in ships ’ water intake . The size of the ship determines how deep the intake tube is , and steel ships warm up tremendously under sunny , hot conditions . The buoy temperatures , which are measured by precise electronic thermistors , were adjusted upwards to match the questionable ship data . Given that the buoy network became more extensive during the pause , that ’s guaranteed to put some artificial warming in the data . The second big adjustment was over the Arctic Ocean , where there are n’t any weather stations . In this revision , temperatures were estimated from nearby land stations . This runs afoul of basic physics . Even in warm summers , there ’s plenty of ice over much of the Arctic Ocean . Now , for example , when the sea ice is nearing its annual minimum , it still extends part way down Greenland ’s east coast . As long as the ice - water mix is well - stirred ( like a glass of ice water ) , the surface temperature stays at the freezing point until all the ice melts . So , extending land readings over the Arctic Ocean adds nonexistent warming to the record . Further , both global and United States data have been frequently adjusted . There is nothing scientifically wrong with adjusting data to correct for changes in the way temperatures are observed and for changes in the thermometers . But each serial adjustment has tended to make the early years colder , which increases the warming trend . That ’s wildly improbable . In addition , thermometers are housed in standardized instrument shelters , which are to be kept a specified shade of white . Shelters in poorer countries are not repainted as often , and darker stations absorb more of the sun ’s energy . It ’s no surprise that poor tropical countries show the largest warming from this effect . All this is to say that the weather balloon and satellite temperatures used in Christy ’s testimony are the best data we have , and they show that the U.N. ’s climate models just are n’t ready for prime time .","['Inaccurate', 'Misleading', 'Cherry-picking', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/why-are-climate-change-models-so-flawed-because-climate-science-is-so-incomplete-jeff-jacoby-boston-globe/,"Replied Pruitt : “ No . I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do , and there ’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact . So no — I would not agree that it ’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see . But we do n’t know that yet . We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis . ” It was an accurate and judicious answer , so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation . The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “ denier ” driven by “ unreason . ” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt ’s views “ extreme ” and “ irresponsible ” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA . Gina McCarthy , who ran the agency under President Obama , bewailed the danger global warming poses “ to all of us who call Earth home , ” and said she could n’t “ imagine what additional information [ Pruitt ] might want from scientists ” in order to understand that . Yet for all the hyperventilating , Pruitt ’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate ’s “ primary control knob ” — was entirely sound . “ We do n’t know that yet , ” he said . We do n’t . CO2 is certainly a heat - trapping greenhouse gas , but hardly the primary one : Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases . By contrast , carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere : about 400 ppm ( parts per million ) , or 0.04 percent . Moreover , its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm . Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red . A second coat of paint has much less of an effect , while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all . There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor , thereby increasing warming through a “ positive feedback loop . ” But that theory so far is mostly speculative ; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed , nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred . It should go without saying that if scientists can not yet make accurate predictions about future climate change , then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete . Earth ’s climate system is unfathomably complex . It is affected by innumerable interacting variables , atmospheric CO2 levels being just one . The more variables there are in any system or train of events , the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass . Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2 , but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e. , ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable : just 1 in 8 . Apply that approach to climate change , and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists ’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism . The list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation , topography , altitude , proximity to the equator , plate tectonics , sunspot cycles , volcanic activity , expansion or contraction of sea ice , conversion of land to agriculture , deforestation , reforestation , direction of winds , soil quality , El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles , prevalence of aerosols ( airborne soot , dust , and salt ) — and , of course , atmospheric greenhouse gases , both natural and manmade . A comprehensive list would run to hundreds , if not thousands , of elements , none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision . But for the sake of argument , say there are merely 15 variables involved in predicting global climate change , and assume that climatologists have mastered each one to a near - perfect accuracy of 95 percent . What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable ? Less than 50/50 . ( Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent . ) Is it any surprise that climate - change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record ? Pruitt got it right : Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “ very challenging . ” The science is far from settled . That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we do n’t are little better than reckless fearmongering .","['Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Inaccurate']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/antarctica-doomsday-glaciers-could-flood-coastal-cities-grist-eric-holthaus/,"In a remote region of Antarctica known as Pine Island Bay , 2,500 miles from the tip of South America , two glaciers hold human civilization hostage . Stretching across a frozen plain more than 150 miles long , these glaciers , named Pine Island and Thwaites , have marched steadily for millennia toward the Amundsen Sea , part of the vast Southern Ocean . Further inland , the glaciers widen into a two - mile - thick reserve of ice covering an area the size of Texas . There ’s no doubt this ice will melt as the world warms . The vital question is when . The glaciers of Pine Island Bay are two of the largest and fastest - melting in Antarctica . ( A Rolling Stone feature earlier this year dubbed Thwaites “ The Doomsday Glacier . ” ) Together , they act as a plug holding back enough ice to pour 11 feet of sea - level rise into the world ’s oceans — an amount that would submerge every coastal city on the planet . For that reason , finding out how fast these glaciers will collapse is one of the most important scientific questions in the world today . To figure that out , scientists have been looking back to the end of the last ice age , about 11,000 years ago , when global temperatures stood at roughly their current levels . The bad news ? There ’s growing evidence that the Pine Island Bay glaciers collapsed rapidly back then , flooding the world ’s coastlines — partially the result of something called “ marine ice - cliff instability . ” The ocean floor gets deeper toward the center of this part of Antarctica , so each new iceberg that breaks away exposes taller and taller cliffs . Ice gets so heavy that these taller cliffs ca n’t support their own weight . Once they start to crumble , the destruction would be unstoppable . “ Ice is only so strong , so it will collapse if these cliffs reach a certain height , ” explains Kristin Poinar , a glaciologist at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center . “ We need to know how fast it ’s going to happen . ” In the past few years , scientists have identified marine ice - cliff instability as a feedback loop that could kickstart the disintegration of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet this century — much more quickly than previously thought . Minute - by - minute , huge skyscraper - sized shards of ice cliffs would crumble into the sea , as tall as the Statue of Liberty and as deep underwater as the height of the Empire State Building . The result : a global catastrophe the likes of which we ’ve never seen . Ice comes in many forms , with different consequences when it melts . Floating ice , like the kind that covers the Arctic Ocean in wintertime and comprises ice shelves , does n’t raise sea levels . ( Think of a melting ice cube , which wo n’t cause a drink to spill over . ) Land - based ice , on the other hand , is much more troublesome . When it falls into the ocean , it adds to the overall volume of liquid in the seas . Thus , sea - level rise . Antarctica is a giant landmass — about half the size of Africa — and the ice that covers it averages more than a mile thick . Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming , the continent ’s ice was in relative balance : The snows in the interior of the continent roughly matched the icebergs that broke away from glaciers at its edges . Now , as carbon dioxide traps more heat in the atmosphere and warms the planet , the scales have tipped . A wholesale collapse of Pine Island and Thwaites would set off a catastrophe . Giant icebergs would stream away from Antarctica like a parade of frozen soldiers . All over the world , high tides would creep higher , slowly burying every shoreline on the planet , flooding coastal cities and creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees . All this could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years — much too quickly for humanity to adapt . “ With marine ice cliff instability , sea - level rise for the next century is potentially much larger than we thought it might be five or 10 years ago , ” Poinar says . A lot of this newfound concern is driven by the research of two climatologists : Rob DeConto at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst and David Pollard at Penn State University . A study they published last year was the first to incorporate the latest understanding of marine ice - cliff instability into a continent - scale model of Antarctica . Their results drove estimates for how high the seas could rise this century sharply higher . “ Antarctic model raises prospect of unstoppable ice collapse , ” read the headline in the scientific journal Nature , a publication not known for hyperbole . Instead of a three - foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century , six feet was more likely , according to DeConto and Pollard ’s findings . But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst - case scenario , the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up , their study showed . Three feet of sea - level rise would be bad , leading to more frequent flooding of U.S. cities such as New Orleans , Houston , New York , and Miami . Pacific Island nations , like the Marshall Islands , would lose most of their territory . Unfortunately , it now seems like three feet is possible only under the rosiest of scenarios . At six feet , though , around 12 million people in the United States would be displaced , and the world ’s most vulnerable megacities , like Shanghai , Mumbai , and Ho Chi Minh City , could be wiped off the map .","['Alarmist', 'Sound_reasoning']"

So , let ’s clear the air and create a more accurate picture of where we really stand on the issue of global warming or , as it is now called—“climate change . ” There are basically three groups of people dealing with this issue . Groups one and two are scientists . Group three consists mostly , at its core , of politicians , environmentalists and the media . Group one is associated with the scientific part of the United Nation ’s International Panel on Climate Change or IPCC ( Working Group 1 ) . These are scientists who mostly believe that recent climate change is primarily due to man ’s burning of fossil fuels — oil , coal and natural gas . This releases C02 , carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere and , they believe , this might eventually dangerously heat the planet . Group two is made up of scientists who do n’t see this as an especially serious problem . This is the group I belong to . We ’re usually referred to as skeptics . We note that there are many reasons why the climate changes — the sun , clouds , oceans , the orbital variations of the earth , as well as a myriad of other inputs . None of these is fully understood , and there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor . But actually there is much agreement between both groups of scientists . The following are such points of agreement : 1 ) The climate is always changing . 2 ) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible , but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming . 3 ) Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century . 4 ) Over this period ( the past two centuries ) , the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius ; but only since the 1960 ’s have man ’s greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role . 5 ) Given the complexity of climate , no confident prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made . The IPCC acknowledged in its own 2007 report that “ The long - term prediction of future climate states is not possible . ” Most importantly , the scenario that the burning of fossil fuel leads to catastrophe is n’t part of what either group asserts . So why are so many people worried , indeed , panic stricken about this issue . Here ’s where Group Three comes in — the politicians , environmentalists , and media . Global warming alarmism provides them , more than any other issue , with the things they most want : For politicians it ’s money and power . For environmentalists it ’s money for their organizations and confirmation of their near religious devotion to the idea that man is a destructive force acting upon nature . And for the media it ’s ideology , money , and headlines . Doomsday scenarios sell . Meanwhile , over the last decade , scientists outside of climate physics have jumped on the bandwagon , publishing papers blaming global warming for everything from acne to the Syrian civil war . And crony capitalists have eagerly grabbed for the subsidies that governments have so lavishly provided . Unfortunately , group three is winning the argument because they have drowned out the serious debate that should be going on . But while politicians , environmentalists and media types can waste a lot of money and scare a lot of people , they wo n’t be able to bury the truth . The climate will have the final word on that .

https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scorching-earth-global-warming-blame-all-time-heat-records-worldwide-daily-mail-joe-pinkstone/,"Temperature records worldwide have been shattered by an unusual global heatwave . Stifling heat cracked roads and buckled roofs across Britain last week , as Motherwell hit the highest temperature ever recorded in Scotland at 91.8 ° F ( 33.2 ° C ) . The heatwave has spread across the world , with Meteo France placing 21 departments across the country on an orange weather alert , while Oman saw the highest nighttime temperature ever recorded on the planet . At least eight people have been killed by the stifling heat sweeping North America , with Montreal recording its hottest temperature since records began . Worse still , the stifling temperatures look set to continue across the Northern Hemisphere , meteorologists have warned . While an isolated heatwave can be put down as an anomaly , the scale of this phenomenon points to global warming as the culprit , scientists said . In a prolonged and unusually intense bout of sunshine , much of the Northern Hemisphere has experienced uncharacteristically warm temperatures . The scale of this latest phenomenon suggests global warming is to blame , scientists have cautioned . ' Summers keep getting hotter , ' said Friederike Otto of the University of Oxford , who conducted extensive research into data from the heatwave that spread Europe in June , July and August 2017 . ' Heatwaves are far more intense than when my parents were growing up in the 1950s . ' If we do nothing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions , the kind of extreme heat we saw this past summer will be the norm when my young son is a grown man . ' North America has seen a staggering rise in temperature . There are already reports of at least eight heat - related deaths in Canada and the United States , stretching back to last weekend , including six in Montreal . The latter broke the previous record for the city 's hottest temperature , as readings from earlier this week showed it reached 97.9 ° F ( 36.6 Celsius ) . Denver , the Colorado state capital that famously resides one mile above sea level , also saw a record temperature of 105 ° F ( 40.5 ° C ) last week . That ties with its previous all - time record , which was set July 20 2005 . The swathe of new records are believed to be connected to the intense heat dome that has consumed most of the United States and southeast Canada since late June . Experts expect the dome to hang over the northeast for at least another week , and predict it will spread west this weekend . On the other side of the Atlantic ocean , climates are typically milder as a result of the cooling from the Gulf Stream . But despite this , the summer of 2018 looks set to be one of the hottest on record . Scotland has experienced the hottest temperature on record , with the UK Met Office reporting Motherwell , which is located some 12 miles ( 20 km ) southeast of Glasgow , hit 91.8 ° F ( 33.2 ° C ) on June 28 . The previous Scottish record of 91.2 ° F ( 32.9 ° C ) was set in August 2003 at Greycrook . Additionally , Glasgow had its hottest day on record , hitting 89.4 ° F ( 31.9 ° C ) . Over the Irish Sea , temperatures also soared despite cooling breezes rolling off the Atlantic . Belfast hit a new record of 85.1 degrees ( 29.5 Celsius ) on June 28 , as Castlederg in northern Ireland set a new record for the UK as a whole , topping out at 86.2 ° F ( 30.1 ° C ) the following day . Meteorologist Emma Salter told the Daily Express : ' High pressure over the country will slip away on Wednesday and Thursday so it will be a couple of degrees fresher , unfortunately this will be barely noticeable . ' There is another area of high pressure which will take charge later this week and temperatures will creep up towards the weekend when we could be back to 30 ° C . ' There will be a bit of cloud over the south which might make it feel slightly cooler but this will clear pretty rapidly . ' Then we are back to stunning blue skies and sunshine and there is no sign of this weather breaking right up until the middle of July which is unusual . ' The long - range trend is for above - average temperatures staying until the end of July with only a couple of changeable spells in this period . ' Public health England ( PHE ) has issued a level two health warning with regards to the unusual heat . It cautions : ' Temperatures are expected to temporarily reduce a little night and day through the middle of this week , before lighter winds allow higher temperatures across more eastern areas of England during Thursday and to some extent during Friday . This alert has been issued for the maximum duration possible . ' It is very likely to be extended for similar areas later this working week as heat is expected to build towards the weekend and possibly during the following week . ' Even in areas that do not breach their alert criteria , the headline is that it is expected to remain largely dry , often sunny and very warm at times . ' Experts said over the weekend that Britain 's heatwave is expected to continue for at least another two weeks . While the islands in Western Europe smouldered in the heatwave , Eurasia was also basking in a heatwave . Yerevan , which is located in the previously Soviet state of Armenia , saw temperatures soar to 107.6 ° F ( 42 ° C ) . This was the country 's hottest day in July , and is tied with the hottest ever day . Russia , the host nation for the FIFA World Cup this year , is also in the midst of a heatwave . Several spots across the south of the world 's largest country either matched or exceeded their warmest June temperatures .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/article-in-the-guardian-misleads-readers-about-sensitivity-of-climate-models-by-narrowly-focusing-on-single-study-jonathan-watts/,"Worst - case global heating scenarios may need to be revised upwards in light of a better understanding of the role of clouds , scientists have said . Recent modelling data suggests the climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than previously believed , and experts said the projections had the potential to be “ incredibly alarming ” , though they stressed further research would be needed to validate the new numbers . Modelling results from more than 20 institutions are being compiled for the sixth assessment by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which is due to be released next year . Compared with the last assessment in 2014 , 25 % of them show a sharp upward shift from 3C to 5C in climate sensitivity – the amount of warming projected from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide from the preindustrial level of 280 parts per million . This has shocked many veteran observers , because assumptions about climate sensitivity have been relatively unchanged since the 1980s . “ That is a very deep concern , ” Johan Rockström , the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research , said . “ Climate sensitivity is the holy grail of climate science . It is the prime indicator of climate risk . For 40 years , it has been around 3C. Now , we are suddenly starting to see big climate models on the best supercomputers showing things could be worse than we thought . ” He said climate sensitivity above 5C would reduce the scope for human action to reduce the worst impacts of global heating . “ We would have no more space for a soft landing of 1.5C [ above preindustrial levels ] . The best we could aim for is 2C , ” he said . Worst - case projections in excess of 5C have been generated by several of the world ’s leading climate research bodies , including the UK Met Office ’s Hadley Centre and the EU ’s Community Earth System Model . Timothy Palmer , a professor in climate physics at Oxford University and a member of the Met Office ’s advisory board , said the high figure initially made scientists nervous . “ It was way outside previous estimates . People asked whether there was a bug in the code , ” he said . “ But it boiled down to relatively small changes in the way clouds are represented in the models . ” The role of clouds is one of the most uncertain areas in climate science because they are hard to measure and , depending on altitude , droplet temperature and other factors , can play either a warming or a cooling role . For decades , this has been the focus of fierce academic disputes . Previous IPCC reports tended to assume that clouds would have a neutral impact because the warming and cooling feedbacks would cancel each other out . But in the past year and a half , a body of evidence has been growing showing that the net effect will be warming . This is based on finer resolution computer models and advanced cloud microphysics . “ Clouds will determine humanity ’s fate – whether climate is an existential threat or an inconvenience that we will learn to live with , ” said Palmer . “ Most recent models suggest clouds will make matters worse . ” In a recent paper in the journal Nature , Palmer explains how the new Hadley Centre model that produced the 5+C figure on climate sensitivity was tested by assessing its accuracy in forecasting short - term weather . This testing technique had exposed flaws in previous models , but in the latest case , the results reinforced the estimates . “ The results are not reassuring – they support the estimates , ” he wrote . He is calling for other models to be tested in a similar way . “ It ’s really important . The message to the government and public is , you have to take this high climate sensitivity seriously . [ We ] must get emissions down as quickly as we can , ” he said . The IPCC is expected to include the 5+C climate sensitivity figure in its next report on the range of possible outcomes . Scientists caution that this is a work in progress and that doubts remain because such a high figure does not fit with historical records . Catherine Senior , head of understanding climate change at the Met Office Hadley Centre , said more studies and more data were needed to fully understand the role of clouds and aerosols . “ This figure has the potential to be incredibly alarming if it is right , ” she said . “ But as a scientist , my first response is : why has the model done that ? We are still in the stage of evaluating the processes driving the different response . ” While acknowledging the continued uncertainty , Rockström said climate models might still be underestimating the problem because they did not fully take into account tipping points in the biosphere . “ The more we learn , the more fragile the Earth system seems to be and the faster we need to move , ” he said . “ It gives even stronger argument to step out of this Covid-19 crisis and move full speed towards decarbonising the economy .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-op-ed-claiming-scientists-underestimated-climate-change-lacks-supporting-evidence-eugene-linden/,"For decades , most scientists saw climate change as a distant prospect . We now know that thinking was wrong . This summer , for instance , a heat wave in Europe penetrated the Arctic , pushing temperatures into the 80s across much of the Far North and , according to the Belgian climate scientist Xavier Fettweis , melting some 40 billion tons of Greenland ’s ice sheet . Had a scientist in the early 1990s suggested that within 25 years a single heat wave would measurably raise sea levels , at an estimated two one - hundredths of an inch , bake the Arctic and produce Sahara - like temperatures in Paris and Berlin , the prediction would have been dismissed as alarmist . But many worst - case scenarios from that time are now realities . Science is a process of discovery . It can move slowly as the pieces of a puzzle fall together and scientists refine their investigative tools . But in the case of climate , this deliberation has been accompanied by inertia born of bureaucratic caution and politics . A recent essay in Scientific American argued that scientists “ tend to underestimate the severity of threats and the rapidity with which they might unfold ” and said one of the reasons was “ the perceived need for consensus . ” This has had severe consequences , diluting what should have been a sense of urgency and vastly understating the looming costs of adaptation and dislocation as the planet continues to warm . In 1990 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the United Nations group of thousands of scientists representing 195 countries , said in its first report that climate change would arrive at a stately pace , that the methane - laden Arctic permafrost was not in danger of thawing , and that the Antarctic ice sheets were stable . Relying on the climate change panel ’s assessment , economists estimated that the economic hit would be small , providing further ammunition against an aggressive approach to reducing emissions and to building resilience to climate change . As we now know , all of those predictions turned out to be completely wrong . Which makes you wonder whether the projected risks of further warming , dire as they are , might still be understated . How bad will things get ? So far , the costs of underestimation have been enormous . New York City ’s subway system did not flood in its first 108 years , but Hurricane Sandy ’s 2012 storm surge caused nearly $ 5 billion in water damage , much of which is still not repaired . In 2017 , Hurricane Harvey gave Houston and the surrounding region a $ 125 billion lesson about the costs of misjudging the potential for floods . The climate change panel seems finally to have caught up with the gravity of the climate crisis . Last year , the organization detailed the extraordinary difficulty of limiting warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1.5 degrees Celsius ) , over the next 80 years , and the grim consequences that will result even if that goal is met . More likely , a separate United Nations report concluded , we are headed for warming of at least 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit . That will come with almost unimaginable damage to economies and ecosystems . Unfortunately , this dose of reality arrives more than 30 years after human - caused climate change became a mainstream issue . The word “ upended ” does not do justice to the revolution in climate science wrought by the discovery of sudden climate change . The realization that the global climate can swing between warm and cold periods in a matter of decades or even less came as a profound shock to scientists who thought those shifts took hundreds if not thousands of years . Scientists knew major volcanic eruptions or asteroid strikes could affect climate rapidly , but such occurrences were uncommon and unpredictable . Absent such rare events , changes in climate looked steady and smooth , a consequence of slow - moving geophysical factors like the earth ’s orbital cycle in combination with the tilt of the planet ’s axis , or shifts in the continental plates . Then , in the 1960s , a few scientists began to focus on an unusual event that took place after the last ice age . Scattered evidence suggested that the post - ice age warming was interrupted by a sudden cooling that began around 12,000 years ago and ended abruptly 1,300 years later . The era was named the Younger Dryas for a plant that proliferated during that cold period . At first , some scientists questioned the rapidity and global reach of the cooling . A report from the National Academies of Science in 1975 acknowledged the Younger Dryas but concluded that it would take centuries for the climate to change in a meaningful way . But not everyone agreed . The climate scientist Wallace Broecker at Columbia had offered a theory that changes in ocean circulation could bring about sudden climate shifts like the Younger Dryas . And it was Dr. Broecker who , in 1975 , the same year as that National Academies report playing down the Younger Dryas , published a paper , titled “ Climatic Change : Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming ? ” in which he predicted that emissions of carbon dioxide would raise global temperatures significantly in the 21st century . This is now seen as prophetic , but at the time , Dr. Broecker was an outlier . Then , in the early 1990s , scientists completed more precise studies of ice cores extracted from the Greenland ice sheet . Dust and oxygen isotopes encased in the cores provided a detailed climate record going back eons . It revealed that there had been 25 rapid climate change events like the Younger Dryas in the last glacial period .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/the-telegraph-christopher-booker-arctic-ice-has-made-fools-of-warmists/,"Two events last week brought yet further twists to one of the longest - running farces of our modern world . One was the revelation by the European Space Agency that in 2013 and 2014 , after years when the volume of Arctic ice had been diminishing , it increased again by as much as 33 per cent . The other was that Canadian scientists studying the effect of climate change on Arctic ice from an icebreaker had to suspend their research , when their vessel was called to the aid of other ships trapped in the thickest summer ice seen in Hudson Bay for 20 years . For more than a decade now , the belief that , thanks to global warming , Arctic ice was vanishing has been for the warmists the ultimate poster - child for their cause ( along with those “ vanishing ” polar bears ) . In 2007 , with the aid of scientists such as Wieslaw Maslowski and Peter Wadhams , the BBC and others were telling us that the Arctic would be totally “ ice free by 2013 ” ( the Independent even cleared its front page to announce that the ice could all have disappeared within weeks ) . By 2011 , the BBC ’s science editor Richard Black was telling us that the ice would “ probably be gone within this decade ” . In 2012 , his colleague Roger Harrabin was reporting that the sea ice was now melting so fast that more had vanished that summer than “ at any time since satellite records began ” . So taken in had others been by all these dire predictions , that in 2008 the activist Gordon Lewis Pugh , after speaking at a conference alongside Al Gore , set out to paddle a kayak to the North Pole – only to have to abort his trip after a few days because “ the ice was too thick ” . In 2009 , the three - man Caitlin expedition , sponsored by a “ climate risk ” insurance company , and backed by the BBC and the Prince of Wales , set out to walk to the North Pole . Their intention was to measure the thickness of the vanishing ice with an electronic instrument , but it froze so hard that they had to resort to a tape measure . Again , after a few weeks , they had to be airlifted back to a rescue ship because the constantly shifting ice was “ too thick ” . In December 2013 , the world followed agog the plight of yet another “ scientific expedition ” , when 52 climate activists , accompanied by reporters from the BBC and the Guardian , sailed into the Antarctic to measure the effects of global warming on its sea - ice . By Christmas their ship was so dangerously trapped by thick , multi - year ice that they had to be helicoptered to a Chinese ship 10 miles away , which itself then got so trapped in ice that they had to be airlifted again to two other ships even further away . What made all this particularly absurd was that , despite being led by an Australian scientist , they were so taken in by the make - believe that they seemed quite oblivious to the satellite records showing that Antarctic sea - ice had long been expanding to such record levels that these more than matched any decline in the Arctic ice at the other end of the world . But was n’t the whole point of this warming that it was meant to be “ global ” ? Of course , the reason why they have all wanted the ice at the poles to melt , not least on the land in Antarctica and Greenland , is that this would bring about their ultimate scare scenario : those sea levels rising by as much as 20 feet , which , as Al Gore showed in his Oscar - winning film An Inconvenient Truth , would flood New York , Shanghai and many of the world ’s most populous cities . But , alas , it just is n’t happening . In recent years there has been more polar ice in the world than at any time since satellite records began in 1979 . In the very year they had forecast that the Arctic would be “ ice free ” , its thickness increased by a third . Polar bear numbers are rising , not falling . Temperatures in Greenland have shown no increase for decades . The greatest scare story of all simply is n’t turning out as their computer models predicted . And no one has been more dangerously taken in by this silly scare story than the warmists themselves .","['Cherry-picking', 'Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Inaccurate']"

These facts refute the claim that Earth is spiraling into one man - made climate catastrophe after another . Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) is portrayed as a demon molecule fueling run - away greenhouse warming . If you get your news only from mainstream media , you would likely believe that CO2 levels are dangerously high and unprecedented . You would be wrong . Concentrations of this gas are slightly less than 420 parts - per - million ( ppm ) , or one - sixth the average historic levels of 2,600 ppm for the last 600 million years . Increases in carbon dioxide in the last 150 years , largely from the burning of fossil fuels , have reversed a dangerous downward trend in the gas ’ concentration . During the last glacial period , concentrations nearly reached the “ line of death ” at 150 parts per million , below which plants die . Viewed in the long - term geologic context , we are actually CO2 impoverished . The most recent claim from the purveyors of climate catastrophe is that recent temperature increases are “ unusual and unprecedented . ” However , records indicate that modern warming began more than 300 years ago in the depths of the horrific Little Ice Age . The first 250 years of that warming preceded 20th century CO2 increases and were necessarily 100 % naturally driven . Context is important when reviewing climate and temperature data . Assertions that the last month or year or decade were the “ hottest on record ” can be true only if your “ record ” is limited to 150 years or so . Longer - term data reveal multiple warming periods since the end of the last major ice age 10,000 years ago , each warmer than today . There is a strong correlation between the rise and fall of temperature and the ebb and flow of civilizations . During the last three warm periods dating back 6,000 years to the advent of the first great civilizations , humanity prospered and great empires arose . Intervening cold periods brought crop failure , famine , and mass depopulation . History advises us to welcome warmth and fear cold . Modestly warming temperature and increasing carbon dioxide lead to longer growing seasons and more productive harvests . The world ’s remarkable ability to increase food production year after year is attributable to mechanization , agricultural innovation , CO2 fertilization , and warmer weather . Crop and food production has seen only positive effects from relatively small changes in the global climate . Contrary to sensational media reports , extreme weather - related deaths in the U.S. have decreased more than 98 % over the last 100 years . Twenty times as many people die from cold as from heat , according to a worldwide review of 74 million temperature - related deaths by Dr. Antonio Gasparrini and a team of physicians . Global warming saves lives . On nearly every key topic , evidence presented in voluminous peer - reviewed studies shows that the “ consensus ” opinion promoted by climate - apocalypse alarmists is consistently at odds with reality . Rather than a world declining into an inescapable man - made climate hell , Earth ’s ecosystems and inhabitants are thriving because of increasing CO2 and rising temperatures not in spite of them . During this period of increasing CO2 and slight warming , we have seen increasing food production , soil moisture , crop growth , and a “ greening ” of the Earth . All the while droughts , forest fires , heat waves , and temperature - related deaths have declined substantially . Only the radical worldview of environmental extremists could ignore the benefits of atmospheric changes while embracing harmful economic policies based on failed climate models . Yes , there is such a thing as the greenhouse effect . Yes , there has been some warming , but it has been minuscule compared to the temperature change all of us experience in the course of a day . Some part of this warming may well have been human - caused . These are matters of widespread agreement . What changes the future holds are hardly certain , but judging from the past , they too will be small . But no , past and possible future warming does not mean that catastrophe will follow , or that measures to prevent global warming are scientifically and economically justified , or that the American values of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness should be blamed for the supposed “ crisis”—still less that they should be destroyed because of highly questionable science .","['Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/futurism-story-great-barrier-reef-compromised-sensational-headline/,"Why care about reefs ? In a word — biodiversity . The reef is home to 3,000 varieties of mollusks , over a hundred types of jellyfish , 1,625 species of fish , hundreds of shark and ray species , and over 30 kinds of whales and dolphins . These sea creatures call the soft and hard corals that make up the reef “ home . ” And without it , many of them will die . If that ’s not enough , it has the distinction of being the largest living structure on the planet . The Great Barrier Reef is home to 3,000 individual coral reefs stretching across a staggering 2,575 kilometers ( 1,600 miles ) , covering an area of about 344,400 square kilometers ( 133,000 square miles . ) Unfortunately , because of back to back mass bleaching events , scientists are telling us that the massive , impressive Australian Great Barrier Reef is now at a ‘ terminal stage’—with large portions having no hope of recovery . Mass bleaching , a phenomenon caused by global warming , is prompted when the water warms to a point that corals begin ejecting the symbiotic algae in their tissue , essential for their survival . Throughout history , there have only been four instances of this occurrence , and after such an event , it will take decades to recover . “ This is the fourth time the Great Barrier Reef has bleached severely – in 1998 , 2002 , 2016 , and now in 2017 . Bleached corals are not necessarily dead corals , but in the severe central region we anticipate high levels of coral loss , ” said researcher James Kerry , from James Cook University ’s ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies , in an official statement . He clarifies why the 2017 bleaching is significant : “ It takes at least a decade for a full recovery of even the fastest growing corals , so mass bleaching events 12 months apart offers zero prospect of recovery for reefs that were damaged in 2016 . ” DEATH TOLL The newest aerial surveys covered over 8,000 kilometers ( 5,000 ) miles , which includes 800 individual coral reefs . According to the surveys , 1,500 kilometers ( 932 miles ) of the Great Barrier Reef is now bleached . These new statistics come less than a year after 93 percent of the reef suffered severe damage , with reports adding that the effects have also spread further south . Combined with the mass bleaching event , the arrival of Tropical Cyclone Debbie added to the devastation , as it struck a section of the reef that managed to escape the worst of the bleaching . In an interview with The Guardian , scientists note just how dire the situation is . “ We ’ve given up , ” said Jon Brodie , a James Cook University water quality expert , who was referring to inaction on the part of the Australian government . “ It ’s been my life managing water quality , we ’ve failed . ” Unfortunately , in this age of global warming , temperatures are expected to continue rising , which means more of these bleaching events will happen , and they will cause even more damage . And the reality is , this could be the last generation who will get to see the grand beauty of this reef . Fortunately , it ’s not too late for us to save the rest of the planet from the worst effects of climate change . But we must act now .",['Misleading']

Last month marked the planet 's 400th consecutive month with above - average temperatures , federal scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday . The cause for the streak ? Unquestionably , it ’s climate change , caused by humanity 's burning of fossil fuels . "" We live in and share a world that is unequivocally , appreciably and consequentially warmer than just a few decades ago , and our world continues to warm , "" said NOAA climate scientist Deke Arndt .

Portions of Asia also experienced some extreme heat : In southern Pakistan , the town of Nawabshah soared to a scalding 122.4 degrees on April 30 , which may have been the warmest April temperature on record for the globe , according to Meteo France .

The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely , the oceans would rise by six metres around the world , flooding many of the world ’s largest cities . The new study reveals a more accurate estimate of the ice loss by taking better account of the gradual rise of the entire Greenland landmass . When the ice cap was at its peak 20,000 years ago , its great weight depressed the hot , viscous rocks in the underlying mantle . As ice has been shed since , the island has slowly rebounded upwards . Previous satellite estimates of modern ice losses tried to take this into account , but precise new GPS data showed much of Greenland is rising far more rapidly than thought , up to 12 mm a year . This means 19 cubic kilometres more ice is falling into the sea each year , an increase of about 8 % on earlier figures . The faster rebound is thought to be the result of hotter , more elastic mantle rocks under eastern Greenland , a remnant from 40 m years ago when the island passed over the hot spot that now powers Iceland ’s volcanoes . The new work was also able to reconstruct the ice loss from Greenland over millennia and found that the same parts of Greenland - the north - west and south - east - were where most ice is being lost both in the past and today . This means the rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip , but part of a long - term trend being exacerbated by climate change . Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland ’s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea . “ The fact that we are seeing such a similarity of past and present behaviour suggests we could lose ice in these regions for decades into the future , ” said Prof Jonathan Bamber , at the University of Bristol , UK , and one of the international team of scientists who carried out the new study , published in Science Advances . Bamber said the presence of a long - term trend does not mean global warming is not a crucial factor : “ One thing we can be certain of is that a warmer atmosphere and a warmer ocean is only going to accelerate this trend . ” “ The headlines of climate change and melting polar ice are not going to change , ” said Dr Christopher Harig , at the University of Arizona , who was not involved in the study . “ The new research happening now really speaks to the question : ‘ How fast or how much ice can or will melt by the end of the century ? ’ As we understand more the complexity of the ice sheets , these estimates have tended to go up . In my mind , the time for urgency about climate change [ action ] really arrived years ago , and it ’s past time our policy reflected that urgency . ” Dr Pippa Whitehouse , at the University of Durham and also not involved in the new research , said : “ This study highlights the powerful insight that GPS measurements can give into past and present ice loss . Using such measurements , this study demonstrates that some of the highest rates of ice loss across Greenland - both in the past and at present - are found in areas where the ice sheet flows directly into the ocean , making it dangerously susceptible to future warming in both the atmosphere and the ocean . ” The team behind the new research said better estimates of continental rebound rates could be even more significant in estimates of ice loss from the world ’s biggest ice cap , in Antarctica , but that sparse data from the remote continent made analysis difficult . In April , very high temperatures led to a record - breaking early onset of glacier melting in Greenland , while another satellite study in August reaffirmed the rapid loss of ice .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/pope-francis-encyclical-laudato-si/,"1 . “ LAUDATO SI ’ , mi ’ Signore ” – “ Praise be to you , my Lord ” . In the words of this beautiful canticle , Saint Francis of Assisi reminds us that our common home is like a sister with whom we share our life and a beautiful mother who opens her arms to embrace us . “ Praise be to you , my Lord , through our Sister , Mother Earth , who sustains and governs us , and who produces various fruit with coloured flowers and herbs”.[1 ] 2 . This sister now cries out to us because of the harm we have inflicted on her by our irresponsible use and abuse of the goods with which God has endowed her . We have come to see ourselves as her lords and masters , entitled to plunder her at will . The violence present in our hearts , wounded by sin , is also reflected in the symptoms of sickness evident in the soil , in the water , in the air and in all forms of life . This is why the earth herself , burdened and laid waste , is among the most abandoned and maltreated of our poor ; she “ groans in travail ” ( Rom 8:22 ) . We have forgotten that we ourselves are dust of the earth ( cf . Gen 2:7 ) ; our very bodies are made up of her elements , we breathe her air and we receive life and refreshment from her waters . Nothing in this world is indifferent to us 3 . More than fifty years ago , with the world teetering on the brink of nuclear crisis , Pope Saint John XXIII wrote an Encyclical which not only rejected war but offered a proposal for peace . He addressed his message Pacem in Terris to the entire “ Catholic world ” and indeed “ to all men and women of good will ” . Now , faced as we are with global environmental deterioration , I wish to address every person living on this planet . In my Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium , I wrote to all the members of the Church with the aim of encouraging ongoing missionary renewal . In this Encyclical , I would like to enter into dialogue with all people about our common home . 4 . In 1971 , eight years after Pacem in Terris , Blessed Pope Paul VI referred to the ecological concern as “ a tragic consequence ” of unchecked human activity : “ Due to an ill - considered exploitation of nature , humanity runs the risk of destroying it and becoming in turn a victim of this degradation”.[2 ] He spoke in similar terms to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations about the potential for an “ ecological catastrophe under the effective explosion of industrial civilization ” , and stressed “ the urgent need for a radical change in the conduct of humanity ” , inasmuch as “ the most extraordinary scientific advances , the most amazing technical abilities , the most astonishing economic growth , unless they are accompanied by authentic social and moral progress , will definitively turn against man”.[3 ] 5 . Saint John Paul II became increasingly concerned about this issue . In his first Encyclical he warned that human beings frequently seem “ to see no other meaning in their natural environment than what serves for immediate use and consumption”.[4 ] Subsequently , he would call for a global ecological conversion.[5 ] At the same time , he noted that little effort had been made to “ safeguard the moral conditions for an authentic human ecology”.[6 ] The destruction of the human environment is extremely serious , not only because God has entrusted the world to us men and women , but because human life is itself a gift which must be defended from various forms of debasement . Every effort to protect and improve our world entails profound changes in “ lifestyles , models of production and consumption , and the established structures of power which today govern societies”.[7 ] Authentic human development has a moral character . It presumes full respect for the human person , but it must also be concerned for the world around us and “ take into account the nature of each being and of its mutual connection in an ordered system”.[8 ] Accordingly , our human ability to transform reality must proceed in line with God ’s original gift of all that is.[9 ] 6 . My predecessor Benedict XVI likewise proposed “ eliminating the structural causes of the dysfunctions of the world economy and correcting models of growth which have proved incapable of ensuring respect for the environment”.[10 ] He observed that the world can not be analyzed by isolating only one of its aspects , since “ the book of nature is one and indivisible ” , and includes the environment , life , sexuality , the family , social relations , and so forth . It follows that “ the deterioration of nature is closely connected to the culture which shapes human coexistence”.[11 ] Pope Benedict asked us to recognize that the natural environment has been gravely damaged by our irresponsible behaviour . The social environment has also suffered damage . Both are ultimately due to the same evil : the notion that there are no indisputable truths to guide our lives , and hence human freedom is limitless . We have forgotten that “ man is not only a freedom which he creates for himself . Man does not create himself . He is spirit and will , but also nature”.[12 ] With paternal concern , Benedict urged us to realize that creation is harmed “ where we ourselves have the final word , where everything is simply our property and we use it for ourselves alone . The misuse of creation begins when we no longer recognize any higher instance than ourselves , when we see nothing else but ourselves”.[13 ] United by the same concern 7 .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/tom-harris-deceptive-temperature-record-claims/,"The U.S. government is at it again , hyping meaningless records in a parameter that does not exist in order to frighten us about something that does n’t matter . NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) announced this week that according to their calculations , July 2015 was the hottest month since instrumental records began in 1880 . NOAA says that the record was set by eight one - hundredths of a degree Celsius over that set in July 1998 . NASA calculates that July 2015 beat what they assert was the previous warmest month ( July 2011 ) by two one - hundredths of a degree . But government spokespeople rarely mention the inconvenient fact that these records are being set by less than the uncertainty in the statistics . NOAA claims an uncertainty of 14 one - hundredths of a degree in its temperature averages , or near twice the amount by which they say the record was set . NASA says that their data is typically accurate to one tenth of a degree , five times the amount by which their new record was set . So , the new temperature records are meaningless . Neither agency knows whether a record was set . Such misrepresentations are now commonplace in NOAA and NASA announcements . They are regularly proclaiming monthly and yearly records set by less than the uncertainties in the measurements . Scientists within the agencies know that this is dishonest . They also know that calculating so - called global average temperatures to hundredths of a degree is irrational . After all , there is very little data for the 70 percent of Earth ’s surface that is ocean . There is also little data for mountainous and desert regions , not to mention the Antarctic . Much of the coverage is so sparse that NASA is forced to make the ridiculous claim that regions are adequately covered if there is a temperature - sensing station within nearly 750 miles . This is the distance between Ottawa , Canada , and Myrtle Beach , S.C. cities with very different climates . Yet , according to NASA , only one temperature sensing station is necessary for the two cities and the vast area between them to be adequately represented in their network . In the final analysis , it is no more meaningful to calculate an average temperature for a whole planet than it is to calculate the average telephone number in the Washington D.C. phone book . Temperature , like viscosity and density , and of course phone numbers , is not something that can be meaningfully averaged . “ Global temperature ” does not exist . In their award winning book , “ Taken By Storm ” ( 2007 ) , Canadian researchers Christopher Essex and Ross McKitrick explain : “ Temperature is not an amount of something [ like height or weight ] . It is a number that represents the condition of a physical system . In thermodynamics it is known as an intensive quantity , in contrast to quantities like energy , which have an additive property , which we call extensive in thermodynamics . ” Even if enough accurate surface temperature measurements existed to ensure reasonable planetary coverage ( it does n’t ) and to calculate some sort of global temperature statistic , interpreting its significance would be challenging . What averaging rule would you use to handle the data from thousands of temperature - sensing stations ? Mean , mode , median , root mean square ? Science does not tell us . For some groups of close temperature measures ( and NASA and NOAA are dealing with thousands of very close temperatures ) , one method of calculating an average can lead to a determination of warming while another can lead to a conclusion of cooling . Even if you could calculate some sort of meaningful global temperature statistic , the figure would be unimportant . No one and nothing would experience it directly since we all live in regions , not the globe . There is no super - sized being straddling the planet , feeling global averages in temperature . Global warming does not matter . Future generations are bound to ask why America closed its coal - fueled generating stations , its cheapest , most plentiful source of electric power , and wasted billions of dollars trying to stop insignificant changes in imaginary phenomena . The sad answer will be that it had nothing to do with the realities of science , technology or economics . The tragic blunder is based on satisfying political expedience for a privileged few , egged on by vested financial interests , and supported by largely uninformed activists granted the media platforms needed to sway public opinion . As Jay Lehr , science director of the Chicago - based Heartland Institute said , “ It is a scam that dwarfs all others that have come before . ” • Tom Harris is executive director of the Ottawa , Canada - based International Climate Science Coalition .","['Misleading', 'Inaccurate', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/usa-today-op-ed-ignores-evidence-to-claim-climate-change-had-no-role-in-hurricane-florence-roy-spencer/,"Even before Hurricane Florence made landfall somewhere near the border of North and South Carolina , predicted damage from potentially catastrophic flooding from the storm was already being blamed on global warming . Writing for NBC News , Kristina Dahl contended , “ With each new storm , we are forced to question whether this is our new , climate change - fueled reality , and to ask ourselves what we can do to minimize the toll from supercharged storms . ” The theory is that tropical cyclones have slowed down in their speed by about 10 percent over the past 70 years due to a retreat of the jet stream farther north , depriving storms of steering currents and making them stall and keep raining in one location . This is what happened with Hurricane Harvey in Houston last year . But like most claims regarding global warming , the real effect is small , probably temporary , and most likely due to natural weather patterns . Any changes in hurricanes over 70 years , even if real , can easily be part of natural cycles — or incomplete data . Coastal lake sediments along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from 1,000 to 2,000 years ago suggest more frequent and intense hurricanes than occur today . Why ? No one knows . Unusual things happen in nature sometimes The Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635 experienced a Category 3 or 4 storm , with up to a 20 - foot storm surge . While such a storm does not happen in New England anymore , it happened again there in 1675 , with elderly eyewitnesses comparing it to the 1635 storm . Until 2017 , the United States went 11 years without a major hurricane strike — something that is statistically very improbable . Nine years into that 11 - year hurricane drought , a NASA scientist computed it as a 1 - in-177 - year event . My point is that nature varies , and unusual things happen sometimes . Now it ’s fashionable to blame stalling hurricanes on global warming . In the case of Florence , the jet stream is indeed pushed farther north . But examination of a weather map of the atmospheric flow at an altitude of 18,000 feet shows the jet stream is pushed farther south over western North America . This kind of natural variation in atmospheric flow is called weather , not climate change . It ’s just a roll of the dice . Hurricane - steering currents are subject to whatever the weather happens to be when they arrive at the U.S. coast . No one should dismiss or minimize the damage that Florence will likely do . Hurricanes can be deadly . I completely agree with Ms. Dahl 's NBC News piece that “ right now , our number one priority has to be ensuring the safety of those in Florence ’s evolving path , as well as the first responders helping them . ” The cost of storms has risen , not their severity But a major hurricane hits North Carolina on average once every 20 years or so . The last was Fran in 1996 , which is 22 years ago . Coastal residents know they live under a yearly threat of hurricanes , and sometimes ( though relatively rarely ) , one of those hurricanes will be very strong . Well , are n’t we being told these storms are getting stronger on average ? The answer is no . The 30 most costly hurricanes in U.S. history ( according to federal data from January ) show no increase in intensity over time . The monetary cost of damages has increased dramatically in recent decades , but that is due to increasing population , wealth and the amount of vulnerable infrastructure . It ’s not due to stronger storms . If humans have any influence on hurricanes at all , it probably wo n’t be evident for many decades to come . Natural variability is simply too large . This should not be surprising given that humanity ’s greenhouse gas emissions have caused only a1 percent change in the natural energy flows coursing through the climate system . Roy W. Spencer , a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville , is author of the Kindle e - books "" Inevitable Disaster : Why Hurricanes Ca n’t Be Blamed on Global Warming "" and "" Global Warming Skepticism for Busy People .","['Misleading', 'Flawed_reasoning', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-series-accurately-describes-research-antarctic-ice-sheets-sea-level-rise-justin-gillis/,"THE ACCELERATION is making some scientists fear that Antarctica ’s ice sheet may have entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration . Because the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet could raise the sea level dramatically , the continued existence of the world ’s great coastal cities — Miami , New York , Shanghai and many more — is tied to Antarctica ’s fate . Four New York Times journalists joined a Columbia University team in Antarctica late last year to fly across the world ’s largest chunk of floating ice in an American military cargo plane loaded with the latest scientific gear . Inside the cargo hold , an engineer with a shock of white hair directed younger scientists as they threw switches . Gravity meters jumped to life . Radar pulses and laser beams fired toward the ice below . On computer screens inside the plane , in ghostly traces of data , the broad white surface of the Ross Ice Shelf began to yield the secrets hiding beneath . “ We are 9,000 miles from New York , ” said the white - haired engineer , Nicholas Frearson of Columbia . “ But we are connected by the ocean . ” A rapid disintegration of Antarctica might , in the worst case , cause the sea to rise so fast that tens of millions of coastal refugees would have to flee inland , potentially straining societies to the breaking point . Climate scientists used to regard that scenario as fit only for Hollywood disaster scripts . But these days , they can not rule it out with any great confidence . Yet as they try to determine how serious the situation is , the scientists confront a frustrating lack of information . Recent computer forecasts suggest that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at a high level , parts of Antarctica could break up rapidly , causing the ocean to rise six feet or more by the end of this century . That is double the maximum increase that an international climate panel projected only four years ago . But those computer forecasts were described as crude even by the researchers who created them . “ We could be decades too fast , or decades too slow , ” said one of them , Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts , Amherst . “ There are still some really big question marks about the trajectory of future climate around Antarctica . ” Alarmed by the warning signs that parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet are becoming unstable , American and British scientific agencies are joining forces to get better measurements in the main trouble spots . The effort could cost more than $ 25 million and might not produce clearer answers about the fate of the ice until the early 2020s . For scientists working in Antarctica , the situation has become a race against time . Even as the threat from global warming comes into sharper focus , these scientists understand that political leaders — and cities already feeling the effects of a rising sea — need clearer forecasts about the consequences of emissions . That urgent need for insight has led scientists from Columbia to spend the past two Antarctic summers flying over the Ross Ice Shelf , a floating chunk of ice larger than California . The Ross shelf helps to slow the flow of land ice from Antarctica into the ocean . Compared with other parts of Antarctica , the shelf seems stable now , but computer forecasts suggest that it might be vulnerable to rapid collapse in the next few decades . The project to map the structure and depth of the ice shelf in detail , funded by American taxpayers through the National Science Foundation , puts Columbia and its partner institutions on the front lines of one of the world ’s most urgent scientific and political problems . “ Our goal is to understand how to predict what ’s going to happen to the ice sheets , ” said Robin E. Bell , the lead Columbia scientist in charge of the effort . “ We really do n’t know right now . ” Remote as Antarctica may seem , every person in the world who gets into a car , eats a steak or boards an airplane is contributing to the emissions that put the frozen continent at risk . If those emissions continue unchecked and the world is allowed to heat up enough , scientists have no doubt that large parts of Antarctica will melt into the sea . But they do not know exactly what the trigger temperature might be , or whether the recent acceleration of the ice means that Earth has already reached it . The question confronting society , said Richard B. Alley , a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University , is easier to ask than to answer : “ How hot is too hot ? ” In the immersive video below , a military cargo plane flies over the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf . The orange and gray pod beneath the window will map the structure of the shelf with radar , a laser and other sensors .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/paris-agreement-op-ed-us-senator-ted-cruz-misrepresents-costs-benefits-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions/,"CNN — Following a successful international tour and the G-7 Summit in Italy , President Trump has an opportunity to relieve our nation of the unfair and economically devastating requirements of the Paris Agreement , the United Nations climate treaty he pledged to rip up during the campaign . And as soon as possible , President Trump should act on – and keep – his campaign promise . The agreement , signed by the Obama administration last year , would commit the United States to drastically reducing its carbon emissions while allowing some countries to increase theirs . This , all while doing nothing to meaningfully decrease global temperatures . According to a recent National Economic Research Associates Economic Consulting study , the Paris Agreement could obliterate $ 3 trillion of GDP , 6.5 million industrial sector jobs and $ 7,000 in per capita household income from the American economy by 2040 . Meeting the 2025 emissions reduction target alone could subtract $ 250 billion from our GDP and eliminate 2.7 million jobs . The cement , iron and steel , and petroleum refining industries could see their production cut by 21 % 19 % , and 11 % respectively . Not only would these unfair standards reduce American job growth and wages and increase monthly utility costs for hardworking families , they would fundamentally disadvantage the United States in the global economy . The result : our economic output would lag while other countries continued to expand their GDPs . The agreement ’s proponents market it as a panacea for addressing the impacts of climate change , but at its core , it is about increasing government control – over the economy , the energy sector and nearly every aspect of our daily lives . It represents the exact misguided , top - down , government - knows - best approach that American voters resoundingly rejected in 2016 . We can not pursue a path that puts American workers first if we cripple a fossil fuel energy sector that generates 82 % of the energy consumed in the United States . The coal industry alone supplies almost one - third of America ’s electric power – with an increasing amount of clean coal - burning technology becoming available . America is poised to become a net energy exporter over the next decade . We should not abandon that progress at the cost of weakening our energy renaissance and crippling economic growth . And let ’s not forget the massive utility cost increases the agreement would entail . The Clean Power Plan , a major component of fulfilling the agreement , would spike energy costs for working and middle - class Texans by 16 % by 2030 , according to the Economic Reliability Council of Texas , the entity that operates the electric grid for much of our state . We simply can not afford an agreement that puts thousands of Americans out of work , increases their energy costs and devastates our core industries . In return for crippling our economy , the Paris Agreement would do next to nothing to impact global temperatures . Under the EPA ’s own models , if all carbon emissions in America were basically eliminated , global temperatures would only decrease by less than two - tenths of a degree Celsius . While the agreement would have a negligible impact on temperatures , America would be putting itself at a competitive disadvantage . That ’s because while the Obama administration irresponsibly committed America to immediate , real cuts in emissions , our global economic competitors would have no such handicap . In fact , Russia is permitted to increase its emissions approximately 50 % and China and India have no meaningful cap on emissions until 2030 . This disparity among the countries ’ pledges inflicts real losses on our economy now while our rivals continue to grow , industrialize and diversify at their own pace with no implementation costs . In the meantime , the agreement would force American taxpayers to subsidize alternative energy at the expense of clean coal , nuclear power and natural gas – energy resources that actually work for our economy and our environment . The Paris Agreement would also handicap America in the global race for new sources of energy . Russia has committed financial and military assets to the Arctic to stake its claim to the region ’s vast deepwater mineral , oil and gas deposits . China is also exploring and trading for Arctic oil and gas . Meanwhile , American liquefied natural gas struggles with logistical costs that weaken its competitiveness . By allowing our rivals to increase their cooperation and strategic leverage around the world – pressuring our allies and partners , harming domestic job creators and materially reducing our prestige and influence in the process — the agreement would damage America ’s national security as much as our economic security . The emission cuts that the US would have to make today , and the resultant costs for our own energy firms , would weaken our ability to battle our rivals on an equal footing in the drive for untapped energy sources . Efforts to unwind some of the deal ’s more onerous regulations are welcomed , but that is not enough . Unless the US completely withdraws , the Paris Agreement will continue to cause sustained harm to our security and economy , and it keeps the door open for future administrations to use it as means to impose more costly and ineffective energy regulations . We should not let a deal subject to the whims of future administrations or Congresses hang like a wet blanket over our economy – driving up energy prices , devastating our industrial base and bolstering our rivals . I hope President Trump will take the opportunity before him to fulfill the commitment he made and withdraw America from the Paris Agreement .","['Misleading', 'Inaccurate', 'Biased']"
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-post-accurately-describes-ocean-warming-study-with-potential-implications-for-future-carbon-budget-chris-mooney-brady-dennis/,"The world ’s oceans have been soaking up far more excess heat in recent decades than scientists realized , suggesting that Earth could be set to warm even faster than predicted in the years ahead , according to new research published Wednesday . Over the past quarter - century , Earth ’s oceans have retained 60 percent more heat each year than scientists previously had thought , said Laure Resplandy , a geoscientist at Princeton University who led the startling study published Wednesday in the journal Nature . The difference represents an enormous amount of additional energy , originating from the sun and trapped by Earth ’s atmosphere — the yearly amount representing more than eight times the world ’s annual energy consumption . In the scientific realm , the new findings help resolve long - running doubts about the rate of the warming of the oceans before 2007 , when reliable measurements from devices called “ Argo floats ” were put to use worldwide . Before that , differing types of temperature records — and an overall lack of them — contributed to murkiness about how quickly the oceans were heating up . The higher - than - expected amount of heat in the oceans means more heat is being retained within Earth ’s climate system each year , rather than escaping into space . In essence , more heat in the oceans signals that global warming is more advanced than scientists thought . “ We thought that we got away with not a lot of warming in both the ocean and the atmosphere for the amount of CO2 that we emitted , ” said Resplandy , who published the work with experts from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and several other institutions in the United States , China , France and Germany . “ But we were wrong . The planet warmed more than we thought . It was hidden from us just because we did n’t sample it right . But it was there . It was in the ocean already . ” Wednesday ’s study also could have important policy implications . If ocean temperatures are rising more rapidly than previously calculated , that could leave nations even less time to dramatically cut the world ’s emissions of carbon dioxide , in the hope of limiting global warming to the ambitious goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) above preindustrial levels by the end of this century . The world already has warmed one degree Celsius ( 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit ) since the late 19th century . Scientists backed by the United Nations reported this month that with warming projected to steadily increase , the world faces a daunting challenge in trying to limit that warming to only another half - degree Celsius . The group found that it would take “ unprecedented ” action by leaders across the globe over the coming decade to even have a shot at that goal . Meanwhile , the Trump administration has continued to roll back regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions from vehicles , coal plants and other sources and has said it intends to withdraw from the Paris climate accord . In one instance , the administration relied on an assumption that the planet will warm a disastrous seven degrees Fahrenheit , or about four degrees Celsius , by the end of the century in arguing that a proposal to ease vehicle fuel - efficiency standards would have only minor climate impacts . The new research underscores the potential consequences of global inaction . Rapidly warming oceans mean that seas will rise faster and that more heat will be delivered to critical locations that already are facing the effects of a warming climate , such as coral reefs in the tropics and the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica . “ In case the larger estimate of ocean heat uptake turns out to be true , adaptation to — and mitigation of — our changing climate would become more urgent , ” said Pieter Tans , who is the leader of the Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases Group at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and was not involved in the study . The oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the excess energy trapped within the world ’s atmosphere . The new research does not measure the ocean ’s temperature directly . Rather , it measures the volume of gases , specifically oxygen and carbon dioxide , that have escaped the ocean in recent decades and headed into the atmosphere as it heats up . The method offered scientists a reliable indicator of ocean temperature change because it reflects a fundamental behavior of a liquid when heated . “ When the ocean warms , it loses some gas to the atmosphere , ” Resplandy said . “ That ’s an analogy that I make all the time : If you leave your Coke in the sun , it will lose the gas . ” This approach allowed researchers to recheck the contested history of ocean temperatures in a different and novel way . In doing so , they came up with a higher number for how much warming the oceans have experienced over time . “ I feel like this is a triumph of Earth - system science . That we could get confirmation from atmospheric gases of ocean heat content is extraordinary , ” said Joellen Russell , a professor and oceanographer at the University of Arizona . “ You ’ve got the A team here on this paper . ” But Russell said the findings are hardly as uplifting . The report “ does have implications for climate sensitivity , meaning , how warm does a certain amount of CO2 make us ? ” Russell said , adding that the world could have a smaller “ carbon budget ” than once thought . That budget refers to the amount of carbon dioxide humans can emit while still being able to keep warming below dangerous levels .",['Sound_reasoning']
https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/article-by-cnn-exaggerates-studys-implications-for-future-greenland-ice-loss/,"Greenland 's ice sheet has melted to a point of no return , and efforts to slow global warming will not stop it from disintegrating . That 's according to a new study by researchers at Ohio State University . "" The ice sheet is now in this new dynamic state , where even if we went back to a climate that was more like what we had 20 or 30 years ago , we would still be pretty quickly losing mass , "" Ian Howat , co - author of the study and a professor at Ohio State University , said . Greenland 's ice sheet dumps more than 280 billion metric tons of melting ice into the ocean each year , making it the greatest single contributor to global sea level rise , according to Michalea King , the lead author of the study and researcher at Ohio State University . The ice loss has been so massive in recent years , she said , that it has caused a measurable change in the gravitational field over Greenland . Ice melting in Greenland contributes more than a millimeter rise to sea level every year , and that 's likely to get worse . Sea levels are projected to rise by more than 3 feet by the end of the century , wiping away beaches and coastal properties . Coastal states like Florida , and low - lying island nations are particularly vulnerable . Just 3 feet of sea level rise could put large areas of coastline underwater . Forty percent of the US population resides in coastal areas that are vulnerable to sea level rise . "" There 's a lot of places , like in Florida especially , where one meter alone would cover a lot of existing land areas , "" King said . "" And that 's exacerbated when you get storms and hurricanes and things like that , that then cause extra surge on top of a higher baseline . "" The study also found that the ice sheet is retreating in rapid bursts , leading to a sudden and unpredictable rise in sea levels , making it difficult to prepare for the effects . The study used four decades of satellite data to measure changes in Greenland 's ice sheet . The authors found that after 2000 , the ice sheet shrank so rapidly that replenishing snowfall would not keep up with the rate of melting from parts of the glacier newly exposed to warmer ocean water , even if climate change were reversed . Entire coasts of ice are retreating at once due to climate change , Howat said , adding that all 200 glaciers that make up the Greenland ice sheet have been observed retreating within the same episode . Even though the retreat of the Greenland Ice sheet likely can not be reversed , it 's just the first in a series of tipping points . If climate change continues at this rate , the rate of melting will get much worse . "" We 've passed the point of no return but there 's obviously more to come , "" Howat said . "" Rather than being a single tipping point in which we 've gone from a happy ice sheet to a rapidly collapsing ice sheet , it 's more of a staircase where we 've fallen off the first step but there 's many more steps to go down into the pit .",['Cherry-picking']
